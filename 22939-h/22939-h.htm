iii</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>The reader will find in this book sketches of experiences among gypsies
of different nations by one who speaks their language and is conversant
with their ways.&nbsp; These embrace descriptions of the justly famed
musical gypsies of St. Petersburg and Moscow, by whom the writer was
received literally as a brother; of the Austrian gypsies, especially those
composing the first Romany orchestra of that country, selected by Liszt,
and who played for their friend as they declared they had never played
before for any man; and also of the English, Welsh, Oriental, and American
brethren of the dark blood and the tents.&nbsp; I believe that the account
of interviews with American gypsies will possess at least the charm of
novelty, but little having as yet been written on this extensive and very
interesting branch of our nomadic population.&nbsp; To these I have added a
characteristic letter in the gypsy language, with translation by a lady,
legendary stories, poems, and finally the substance of two papers, one of
which I read before the British Philological Society, and the other before
<!-- page iv--><a name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. iv</span>the
Oriental Congress at Florence, in 1878.&nbsp; Those who study ethnology
will be interested to learn from these papers, subsequently combined in an
article in the &ldquo;Saturday Review,&rdquo; that I have definitely
determined the existence in India of a peculiar tribe of gypsies, who are
<i>par eminence</i> the Romanys of the East, and whose language is there
what it is in England, the same in vocabulary, and the chief slang of the
roads.&nbsp; This I claim as a discovery, having learned it from a Hindoo
who had been himself a gypsy in his native land.&nbsp; Many writers have
suggested the Jats, Banjars, and others as probable ancestors or
type-givers of the race; but the existence of the <i>Rom himself</i> in
India, bearing the distinctive name of Rom, has never before been set forth
in any book or by any other writer.&nbsp; I have also given what may in
reason be regarded as settling the immensely disputed origin of the word
&ldquo;Zingan,&rdquo; by the gypsies&rsquo; own account of its etymology,
which was beyond all question brought by them from India.</p>
<p>In addition to this I have given in a chapter certain conversations with
men of note, such as Thomas Carlyle, Lord Lytton, Mr. Roebuck, and others,
on gypsies; an account of the first and family names and personal
characteristics of English and American Romanys, prepared for me by a very
famous old gypsy; and finally a chapter on the &ldquo;Shelta Thari,&rdquo;
or Tinkers&rsquo; Language, a very curious jargon or language, never
mentioned before by any writer except Shakespeare.&nbsp; What this tongue
may be, beyond the <!-- page v--><a name="pagev"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. v</span>fact that it is purely Celtic, and that it does
not seem to be identical with any other Celtic dialect, is unknown to
me.&nbsp; I class it with the gypsy, because all who speak it are also
acquainted with Romany.</p>
<p>For an attempt to set forth the tone or feeling in which the sketches
are conceived, I refer the reader to the Introduction.</p>
<p>When I published my &ldquo;English Gypsies and their Language,&rdquo; a
reviewer declared that I &ldquo;had added nothing to our&rdquo; (that is,
his) &ldquo;knowledge on the subject.&rdquo;&nbsp; As it is always pleasant
to meet with a man of superior information, I said nothing.&nbsp; And as I
had carefully read everything ever printed on the Romany, and had given a
very respectable collection of what was new to me as well as to all my
Romany rye colleagues in Europe, I could only grieve to think that such
treasures of learning should thus remain hidden in the brain of one who had
never at any time or in any other way manifested the possession of any
remarkable knowledge.&nbsp; Nobody can tell in this world what others may
know, but I modestly suggest that what I have set forth in this work, on
the origin of the gypsies, though it may be known to the reviewer in
question, has at least never been set before the public by anybody but
myself, and that it deserves further investigation.&nbsp; No account of the
tribes of the East mentions the Rom or Trabl&#363;s, and yet I have
personally met with and thoroughly examined one of them.&nbsp; In like
manner, the &ldquo;Shelta Thari&rdquo; has remained till the present day
entirely <!-- page vi--><a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vi</span>unknown to all writers on either the languages or the nomadic
people of Great Britain.&nbsp; If we are so ignorant of the wanderers among
us, and at our very doors, it is not remarkable that we should be ignorant
of those of India.</p>

9</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>I have frequently been asked, &ldquo;Why do you take an interest in
gypsies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it is not so easy to answer.&nbsp; Why, indeed?&nbsp; In Spain one
who has been fascinated by them is called one of the <i>aficion</i>, or
affection, or &ldquo;fancy;&rdquo; he is an <i>aficionado</i>, or affected
unto them, and people there know perfectly what it means, for every
Spaniard is at heart a Bohemian.&nbsp; He feels what a charm there is in a
wandering life, in camping in lonely places, under old chestnut-trees, near
towering cliffs, <i>al pasar del arroyo</i>, by the rivulets among the
rocks.&nbsp; He thinks of the wine skin and wheaten cake when one was
hungry on the road, of the mules and tinkling bells, the fire by night, and
the <i>cigarito</i>, smoked till he fell asleep.&nbsp; Then he remembers
the gypsies who came to the camp, and the black-eyed girl who told him his
fortune, and all that followed in the rosy dawn and ever onward into starry
night.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Y se alegre el alma llena<br />
De la luz de esos luceros.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And his heart is filled with rapture<br />
At the light of those lights above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This man understands it.&nbsp; So, too, does many an Englishman.&nbsp;
But I cannot tell you why.&nbsp; Why do I love to wander on the roads to
hear the birds; to <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>see old church towers afar, rising over fringes
of forest, a river and a bridge in the foreground, and an ancient castle
beyond, with a modern village springing up about it, just as at the foot of
the burg there lies the falling trunk of an old tree, around which weeds
and flowers are springing up, nourished by its decay?&nbsp; Why love these
better than pictures, and with a more than fine-art feeling?&nbsp; Because
on the roads, among such scenes, between the hedge-rows and by the river, I
find the wanderers who properly inhabit not the houses but the scene, not a
part but the whole.&nbsp; These are the gypsies, who live like the birds
and hares, not of the house-born or the town-bred, but free and at home
only with nature.</p>
<p>I am at some pleasant watering-place, no matter where.&nbsp; Let it be
Torquay, or Ilfracombe, or Aberystwith, or Bath, or Bournemouth, or
Hastings.&nbsp; I find out what old churches, castles, towns, towers,
manors, lakes, forests, fairy-wells, or other charms of England lie within
twenty miles.&nbsp; Then I take my staff and sketch-book, and set out on my
day&rsquo;s pilgrimage.&nbsp; In the distance lie the lines of the shining
sea, with ships sailing to unknown lands.&nbsp; Those who live in them are
the Bohemians of the sea, homing while roaming, sleeping as they go, even
as gypsies dwell on wheels.&nbsp; And if you look wistfully at these ships
far off and out at sea with the sun upon their sails, and wonder what
quaint mysteries of life they hide, verily you are not far from being
affected or elected unto the Romany.&nbsp; And if, when you see the wild
birds on the wing, wending their way to the South, and wish that you could
fly with them,&mdash;anywhere, anywhere over the world and into
adventure,&mdash;then you are not far in spirit from the <!-- page 11--><a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>kingdom of Bohemia and
its seven castles, in the deep windows of which &AElig;olian wind-harps
sing forever.</p>
<p>Now, as you wander along, it may be that in the wood and by some grassy
nook you will hear voices, and see the gleam of a red garment, and then
find a man of the roads, with dusky wife and child.&nbsp; You speak one
word, &ldquo;Sarishan!&rdquo; and you are introduced.&nbsp; These people
are like birds and bees, they belong to out-of-doors and nature.&nbsp; If
you can chirp or buzz a little in their language and know their ways, you
will find out, as you sit in the forest, why he who loves green bushes and
mossy rocks is glad to fly from cities, and likes to be free of the joyous
citizenship of the roads, and everywhere at home in such boon company.</p>
<p>When I have been a stranger in a strange town, I have never gone out for
a long walk without knowing that the chances were that I should meet within
an hour some wanderer with whom I should have in common certain
acquaintances.&nbsp; These be indeed humble folk, but with nature and
summer walks they make me at home.&nbsp; In merrie England I could nowhere
be a stranger if I would, and that with people who cannot read; and the
English-born Romany rye, or gentleman speaking gypsy, would in like manner
be everywhere at home in America.&nbsp; There was a gypsy family always
roaming between Windsor and London, and the first words taught to their
youngest child were &ldquo;Romany rye!&rdquo; and these it was trained to
address to me.&nbsp; The little tot came up to me,&mdash;I had never heard
her speak before,&mdash;a little brown-faced, black-eyed thing, and said,
&ldquo;How-do, Omany &rsquo;eye?&rdquo; and great was the triumph and
rejoicing and laughter <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>of the mother and father and all the little
tribe.&nbsp; To be familiar with these wanderers, who live by dale and
down, is like having the bees come to you, as they did to the Dacian
damsel, whose death they mourned; it is like the attraction of the wild
deer to the fair Genevieve; or if you know them to be dangerous outlaws, as
some are, it is like the affection of serpents and other wild things for
those whom nature has made their friends, and who handle them without
fear.&nbsp; They are human, but in their lives they are between man as he
lives in houses and the bee and bird and fox, and I cannot help believing
that those who have no sympathy with them have none for the forest and
road, and cannot be rightly familiar with the witchery of wood and
wold.&nbsp; There are many ladies and gentlemen who can well-nigh die of a
sunset, and be enraptured with &ldquo;bits&rdquo; of color, and captured
with scenes, and to whom all out-of-doors is as perfect as though it were
painted by Millais, yet to whom the bee and bird and gypsy and red Indian
ever remain in their true inner life strangers.&nbsp; And just as strange
to them, in one sense, are the scenes in which these creatures dwell; for
those who see in them only pictures, though they be by Claude and Turner,
can never behold in them the fairy-land of childhood.&nbsp; Only in
Ruysdael and Salvator Rosa and the great unconscious artists lurks the
spell of the Romany, and this spell is unfelt by Mr. Cimabue Brown.&nbsp;
The child and the gypsy have no words in which to express their sense of
nature and its charm, but they have this sense, and there are very, very
few who, acquiring culture, retain it.&nbsp; And it is gradually
disappearing from the world, just as the old delicately sensuous,
na&iuml;ve, picturesque <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>type of woman&rsquo;s beauty&mdash;the
perfection of natural beauty&mdash;is rapidly vanishing in every country,
and being replaced by the mingled real and unreal attractiveness of
&ldquo;cleverness,&rdquo; intellect, and fashion.&nbsp; No doubt the newer
tend to higher forms of culture, but it is not without pain that he who has
been &ldquo;in the spirit&rdquo; in the old Sabbath of the soul, and in its
quiet, solemn sunset, sees it all vanishing.&nbsp; It will all be gone in a
few years.&nbsp; I doubt very much whether it will be possible for the most
unaffectedly natural writer to preserve any of its hieroglyphics for future
Champollions of sentiment to interpret.&nbsp; In the coming days, when man
shall have developed new senses, and when the blessed sun himself shall
perhaps have been supplanted by some tremendous electrical light, and the
moon be expunged altogether as interfering with the new arrangements for
gravity, there will doubtless be a new poetry, and art become to the very
last degree self-conscious of its cleverness, artificial and impressional;
yet even then weary scholars will sigh from time to time, as they read in
our books of the ancient purple seas, and how the sun went down of old into
cloud-land, gorgeous land, and then how all dreamed away into night!</p>
<p>Gypsies are the human types of this vanishing, direct love of nature, of
this mute sense of rural romance, and of <i>al fresco</i> life, and he who
does not recognize it in them, despite their rags and dishonesty, need not
pretend to appreciate anything more in Callot&rsquo;s etchings than the
skillful management of the needle and the acids.&nbsp; Truly they are but
rags themselves; the last rags of the old romance which connected man with
nature.&nbsp; Once romance was a splendid medi&aelig;val drama, colored and
gemmed <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>with chivalry, minnesong, bandit-flashes, and waving plumes; now
there remain but a few tatters.&nbsp; Yes, we were young and foolish then,
but there are perishing with the wretched fragments of the red Indian
tribes mythologies as beautiful as those of the Greek or Norseman; and
there is also vanishing with the gypsy an unexpressed mythology, which
those who are to come after us would gladly recover.&nbsp; Would we not
have been pleased if one of the thousand Latin men of letters whose works
have been preserved had told us how the old Etruscans, then still living in
mountain villages, spoke and habited and customed?&nbsp; But oh that there
had ever lived of old one man who, noting how feelings and sentiments
changed, tried to so set forth the souls of his time that after-comers
might understand what it was which inspired their art!</p>
<p>In the Sanskrit humorous romance of &ldquo;Baital Pachisi,&rdquo; or
King Vikram and the Vampire, twenty-five different and disconnected
trifling stories serve collectively to illustrate in the most pointed
manner the highest lesson of wisdom.&nbsp; In this book the gypsies, and
the scenes which surround them, are intended to teach the lesson of freedom
and nature.&nbsp; Never were such lessons more needed than at
present.&nbsp; I do not say that culture is opposed to the perception of
nature; I would show with all my power that the higher our culture the more
we are really qualified to appreciate beauty and freedom.&nbsp; But gates
must be opened for this, and unfortunately the gates as yet are very few,
while Philistinism in every form makes it a business of closing every
opening to the true fairy-land of delight.</p>
<p>The gypsy is one of many links which connect the <!-- page 15--><a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>simple feeling of
nature with romance.&nbsp; During the Middle Ages thousands of such links
and symbols united nature with religion.&nbsp; Thus Conrad von
W&uuml;rtzburg tells in his &ldquo;Goldene Schmiede&rdquo; that the parrot
which shines in fairest grass-green hue, and yet like common grass is never
wet, sets forth the Virgin, who bestowed on man an endless spring, and yet
remained unchanged.&nbsp; So the parrot and grass and green and shimmering
light all blended in the ideal of the immortal Maid-Mother, and so the bird
appears in pictures by Van Eyck and D&uuml;rer.&nbsp; To me the
gypsy-parrot and green grass in lonely lanes and the rain and sunshine all
mingle to set forth the inexpressible purity and sweetness of the virgin
parent, Nature.&nbsp; For the gypsy is parrot-like, a quaint pilferer, a
rogue in grain as in green; for green was his favorite garb in olden time
in England, as it is to-day in Germany, where he who breaks the Romany law
may never dare on heath to wear that fatal fairy color.</p>
<p>These words are the key to the following book, in which I shall set
forth a few sketches taken during my rambles among the Romany.&nbsp; The
day is coming when there will be no more wild parrots nor wild wanderers,
no wild nature, and certainly no gypsies.&nbsp; Within a very few years in
the city of Philadelphia, the English sparrow, the very cit and cad of
birds, has driven from the gardens all the wild, beautiful feathered
creatures whom, as a boy, I knew.&nbsp; The fire-flashing scarlet tanager
and the humming-bird, the yellow-bird, blue-bird, and golden oriole, are
now almost forgotten, or unknown to city children.&nbsp; So the people of
self-conscious culture and the mart and factory are banishing the wilder
sort, and it <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>is all right, and so it must be, and therewith <i>basta</i>.&nbsp;
But as a London reviewer said when I asserted in a book that the child was
perhaps born who would see the last gypsy, &ldquo;Somehow we feel sorry for
that child.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>THE RUSSIAN GYPSIES.</h2>
<p>It is, I believe, seldom observed that the world is so far from having
quitted the romantic or sentimental for the purely scientific that, even in
science itself, whatever is best set forth owes half its charm to something
delicately and distantly reflected from the forbidden land of fancy.&nbsp;
The greatest reasoners and writers on the driest topics are still
&ldquo;genial,&rdquo; because no man ever yet had true genius who did not
feel the inspiration of poetry, or mystery, or at least of the
unusual.&nbsp; We are not rid of the marvelous or curious, and, if we have
not yet a science of curiosities, it is apparently because it lies for the
present distributed about among the other sciences, just as in small
museums illuminated manuscripts are to be found in happy family union with
stuffed birds or minerals, and with watches and snuff-boxes, once the
property of their late majesties the Georges.&nbsp; Until such a science is
formed, the new one of ethnology may appropriately serve for it, since it
of all presents most attraction to him who is politely called the general
reader, but who should in truth be called the man who reads the most for
mere amusement.&nbsp; For Ethnology deals with such delightful material as
primeval kumbo-cephalic skulls, and appears to her votaries arrayed, not in
silk attire, but in strange fragments <!-- page 18--><a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>of leather from ancient
Irish graves, or in cloth from Lacustrine villages.&nbsp; She glitters with
the quaint jewelry of the first Italian race, whose ghosts, if they wail
over the &ldquo;find,&rdquo; &ldquo;speak in a language man knows no
more.&rdquo;&nbsp; She charms us with etchings or scratchings of mammoths
on mammoth-bone, and invites us to explore mysterious caves, to picnic
among megalithic monuments, and speculate on pictured Scottish
stones.&nbsp; In short, she engages man to investigate his ancestry, a
pursuit which presents charms even to the illiterate, and asks us to find
out facts concerning works of art which have interested everybody in every
age.</p>
<p><i>Ad interim</i>, before the science of curiosities is segregated from
that of ethnology, I may observe that one of the marvels in the latter is
that, among all the subdivisions of the human race, there are only two
which have been, apparently from their beginning, set apart, marked and
cosmopolite, ever living among others, and yet reserved unto
themselves.&nbsp; These are the Jew and the gypsy.&nbsp; From time whereof
history hath naught to the contrary, the Jew was, as he himself holds in
simple faith, the first man.&nbsp; Red Earth, Adam, was a Jew, and the old
claim to be a peculiar people has been curiously confirmed by the
extraordinary genius and influence of the race, and by their boundless
wanderings.&nbsp; Go where we may, we find the Jew&mdash;has any other
wandered so far?</p>
<p>Yes, one.&nbsp; For wherever Jew has gone, there, too, we find the
gypsy.&nbsp; The Jew may be more ancient, but even the authentic origin of
the Romany is lost in ancient Aryan record, and, strictly speaking, his is
a prehistoric caste.&nbsp; Among the hundred and fifty wandering <!-- page
19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>tribes of India
and Persia, some of them Turanian, some Aryan, and others mixed, it is of
course difficult to identify the exact origin of the European gypsy.&nbsp;
One thing we know: that from the tenth to the twelfth century, and probably
much later on, India threw out from her northern half a vast multitude of
very troublesome indwellers.&nbsp; What with Buddhist, Brahman, and
Mohammedan wars,&mdash;invaders outlawing invaded,&mdash;the number of
out-<i>castes</i> became alarmingly great.&nbsp; To these the Jats, who,
according to Captain Burton, constituted the main stock of our gypsies,
contributed perhaps half their entire nation.&nbsp; Excommunication among
the Indian professors of transcendental benevolence meant social death and
inconceivable cruelty.&nbsp; Now there are many historical indications that
these outcasts, before leaving India, became gypsies, which was the most
natural thing in a country where such classes had already existed in very
great numbers from early times.&nbsp; And from one of the lowest castes,
which still exists in India, and is known as the Dom, <a
name="citation19"></a><a href="#footnote19" class="citation">[19]</a> the
emigrants to the West probably derived their name and several
characteristics.&nbsp; The Dom burns the dead, handles corpses, skins
beasts, and performs other functions, all of which were appropriated by,
and became peculiar to, gypsies in several countries in Europe, notably in
Denmark and Holland, for several centuries after their arrival there.&nbsp;
The Dom <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>of the present day also sells baskets, and wanders with a tent; he
is altogether gypsy.&nbsp; It is remarkable that he, living in a hot
climate, drinks ardent spirits to excess, being by no means a
&ldquo;temperate Hindoo,&rdquo; and that even in extreme old age his hair
seldom turns white, which is a noted peculiarity among our own gypsies of
pure blood.&nbsp; I know and have often seen a gypsy woman, nearly a
hundred years old, whose curling hair is black, or hardly perceptibly
changed.&nbsp; It is extremely probable that the Dom, mentioned as a caste
even in the Shastras, gave the name to the Rom.&nbsp; The Dom calls his
wife a Domni, and being a Dom is &ldquo;Domnipana.&rdquo;&nbsp; In English
gypsy, the same words are expressed by <i>Rom</i>, <i>romni</i>, and
<i>romnipen</i>.&nbsp; D, be it observed, very often changes to <i>r</i> in
its transfer from Hindoo to Romany.&nbsp; Thus <i>doi</i>, &ldquo;a wooden
spoon,&rdquo; becomes in gypsy <i>roi</i>, a term known to every tinker in
London.&nbsp; But, while this was probably the origin of the word Rom,
there were subsequent reasons for its continuance.&nbsp; Among the Cophts,
who were more abundant in Egypt when the first gypsies went there, the word
for man is <i>romi</i>, and after leaving Greece and the Levant, or
<i>Rum</i>, it would be natural for the wanderers to be called
<i>Rumi</i>.&nbsp; But the Dom was in all probability the parent stock of
the gypsy race, though the latter received vast accessions from many other
sources.&nbsp; I call attention to this, since it has always been held, and
sensibly enough, that the mere fact of the gypsies speaking Hindi-Persian,
or the oldest type of Urdu, including many Sanskrit terms, does not prove
an Indian or Aryan origin, any more than the English spoken by American
negroes proves a Saxon descent.&nbsp; But if the Rom can be identified <!--
page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>with the
Dom&mdash;and the circumstantial evidence, it must be admitted, is very
strong&mdash;but little remains to seek, since, according to the Shastras,
the Doms are Hindoo.</p>
<p>Among the tribes whose union formed the European gypsy was, in all
probability, that of the <i>Nats</i>, consisting of singing and dancing
girls and male musicians and acrobats.&nbsp; Of these, we are told that not
less than ten thousand lute-players and minstrels, under the name of
<i>Luri</i>, were once sent to Persia as a present to a king, whose land
was then without music or song.&nbsp; This word <i>Luri</i> is still
preserved.&nbsp; The saddle-makers and leather-workers of Persia are called
Tsingani; they are, in their way, low caste, and a kind of gypsy, and it is
supposed that from them are possibly derived the names Zingan, Zigeuner,
Zingaro, etc., by which gypsies are known in so many lands.&nbsp; From Mr.
Arnold&rsquo;s late work on &ldquo;Persia,&rdquo; the reader may learn that
the <i>Eeli</i>, who constitute the majority of the inhabitants of the
southern portion of that country, are Aryan nomads, and apparently
gypsies.&nbsp; There are also in India the Banjari, or wandering merchants,
and many other tribes, all spoken of as gypsies by those who know them.</p>
<p>As regards the great admixture of Persian with Hindi in good Romany, it
is quite unmistakable, though I can recall no writer who has attached
sufficient importance to a fact which identifies gypsies with what is
almost preeminently the land of gypsies.&nbsp; I once had the pleasure of
taking a Nile journey in company with Prince S---, a Persian, and in most
cases, when I asked my friend what this or that gypsy word meant, he gave
me its correct meaning, after a little thought, and then added, in his
imperfect English, &ldquo;What for you want to know <!-- page 22--><a

<i>old</i> word&mdash;that no more used.&nbsp; Only common people&mdash;old
peasant-woman&mdash;use that word&mdash;<i>gentleman</i> no want to know
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; But I did want to know &ldquo;him&rdquo; very much.&nbsp;
I can remember that one night, when our <i>bon prince</i> had thus held
forth, we had dancing girls, or Almeh, on board, and one was very young and
pretty.&nbsp; I was told that she was gypsy, but she spoke no Romany.&nbsp;
Yet her panther eyes and serpent smile and <i>beaut&eacute; du diable</i>
were not Egyptian, but of the Indian, <i>kalo-ratt</i>,&mdash;the dark
blood, which, once known, is known forever.&nbsp; I forgot her, however,
for a long time, until I went to Moscow, when she was recalled by dancing
and smiles, of which I will speak anon.</p>
<p>I was sitting one day by the Thames, in a gypsy tent, when its master,
Joshua Cooper, now dead, pointing to a swan, asked me for its name in
gypsy.&nbsp; I replied, &ldquo;<i>Boro pappin</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>rya</i>.&nbsp; <i>Boro pappin</i> is &lsquo;a big
goose.&rsquo;&nbsp; <i>S&aacute;kk&uacute;</i> is the real gypsy
word.&nbsp; It is very old, and very few Romany know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few days after, when my Persian friend was dining with me at the
Langham Hotel, I asked him if he knew what S&aacute;kk&uacute; meant.&nbsp;
By way of reply, he, not being able to recall the English word, waved his
arms in wonderful pantomime, indicating some enormous winged creature; and
then, looking into the distance, and pointing as if to some far-vanishing
object, as boys do when they declaim Bryant&rsquo;s address &ldquo;To a
Water-Fowl,&rdquo; said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&aacute;kk&uacute;&mdash;one ver&rsquo; big bird, like one
<i>swen</i>&mdash;but he <i>not</i> swen.&nbsp; He like the man who carry
too much water up-stairs <a name="citation22"></a><a href="#footnote22"
class="citation">[22]</a> his head in Constantinople.&nbsp; That <!-- page
23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>bird all same
that man.&nbsp; He <i>sakkia</i> all same wheel that you see get water
up-stairs in Egypt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was explanatory, but far from satisfactory.&nbsp; The prince,
however, was mindful of me, and the next day I received from the Persian
embassy the word elegantly written in Persian, with the translation,
&ldquo;<i>a pelican</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then it was all clear enough, for the
pelican bears water in the bag under its bill.&nbsp; When the gypsies came
to Europe they named animals after those which resembled them in
Asia.&nbsp; A dog they called <i>juckal</i>, from a jackal, and a swan
<i>s&aacute;kk&uacute;</i>, or pelican, because it so greatly resembles
it.&nbsp; The Hindoo <i>bandarus</i>, or monkey, they have changed to
<i>bombaros</i>, but why Tom Cooper should declare that it is
<i>pugasah</i>, or <i>pukkus-asa</i>, I do not know. <a
name="citation23"></a><a href="#footnote23" class="citation">[23]</a>&nbsp;
As little can I conjecture the meaning of the prefix <i>mod</i>, or
<i>mode</i>, which I learned on the road near Weymouth from a very ancient
tinker, a man so battered, tattered, seamed, riven, and wrinkled that he
looked like a petrifaction.&nbsp; He had so bad a barrow, or wheel, that I
wondered what he could do with it, and regarded him as the very poorest man
I had ever seen in England, until his mate came up, an <i>alter ego</i>, so
excellent in antiquity, wrinkles, knobbiness, and rags that he surpassed
the vagabond pictures not only of Callot, Dor&eacute;, and Goya, but even
the unknown Spanish maker of a picture which I met with not long since for
sale, and which for infinite poverty defied anything I ever saw on
canvas.&nbsp; These poor men, who seemed at first amazed that I should
speak to them at all, when I spoke Romany at once called me
&ldquo;brother.&rdquo;&nbsp; When I asked the younger his name, <!-- page
24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>he sank his
voice to a whisper, and, with a furtive air, said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>K&aacute;mlo</i>,&mdash;Lovel, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you call yourself in the way of business?&rdquo; I
asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Katsamengro</i>, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now <i>Katsamengro</i> means scissors-master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a very good word.&nbsp; But <i>chiv&oacute;</i> is
deeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Chiv&oacute;</i> means a knife-man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; But the deepest of all, master, is
<i>Modangar&eacute;ngro</i>.&nbsp; For you see that the right word for
coals isn&rsquo;t <i>wongur</i>, as Romanys generally say, but
<i>Ang&aacute;ra</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now <i>ang&aacute;ra</i>, as Pott and Benfey indicate, is pure Sanskrit
for coals, and <i>angar&eacute;ngro</i> is a worker in coals, but what
<i>mod</i> means I know not, and should be glad to be told.</p>
<p>I think it will be found difficult to identify the European gypsy with
any one stock of the wandering races of India.&nbsp; Among those who left
that country were men of different castes and different color, varying from
the pure northern invader to the negro-like southern Indian.&nbsp; In the
Danubian principalities there are at the present day three kinds of
gypsies: one very dark and barbarous, another light brown and more
intelligent, and the third, or <i>&eacute;lite</i>, of yellow-pine
complexion, as American boys characterize the hue of quadroons.&nbsp; Even
in England there are straight-haired and curly-haired Romanys, the two
indicating not a difference resulting from white admixture, but entirely
different original stocks.</p>
<p>It will, I trust, be admitted, even from these remarks, that Romanology,
or that subdivision of ethnology which treats of gypsies, is both practical
and <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>curious.&nbsp; It deals with the only race except the Jew, which
has penetrated into every village which European civilization has ever
touched.&nbsp; He who speaks Romany need be a stranger in few lands, for on
every road in Europe and America, in Western Asia, and even in Northern
Africa, he will meet those with whom a very few words may at once establish
a peculiar understanding.&nbsp; For, of all things believed in by this
widely spread brotherhood, the chief is this,&mdash;that he who knows the
<i>jib</i>, or language, knows the ways, and that no one ever attained
these without treading strange paths, and threading mysteries unknown to
the Gorgios, or Philistines.&nbsp; And if he who speaks wears a good coat,
and appears a gentleman, let him rest assured that he will receive the
greeting which all poor relations in all lands extend to those of their kin
who have risen in life.&nbsp; Some of them, it is true, manifest the
winsome affection which is based on great expectations, a sentiment largely
developed among British gypsies; but others are honestly proud that a
gentleman is not ashamed of them.&nbsp; Of this latter class were the
musical gypsies, whom I met in Russia during the winter of 1876 and 1877,
and some of them again in Paris during the Exposition of 1878.</p>
<h3>ST. PETERSBURG.</h3>
<p>There are gypsies and gypsies in the world, for there are the wanderers
on the roads and the secret dwellers in towns; but even among the
<i>aficionados</i>, or Romany ryes, by whom I mean those scholars who are
fond of studying life and language from the people themselves, very few
have dreamed that there exist communities of gentlemanly and lady-like
gypsies <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>of art, like the Bohemians of Murger and George Sand, but
differing from them in being real &ldquo;Bohemians&rdquo; by race.&nbsp; I
confess that it had never occurred to me that there was anywhere in Europe,
at the present day, least of all in the heart of great and wealthy cities,
a class or caste devoted entirely to art, well-to-do or even rich, refined
in manners, living in comfortable homes, the women dressing elegantly; and
yet with all this obliged to live by law, as did the Jews once, in Ghettos
or in a certain street, and regarded as outcasts and
<i>cag&ocirc;ts</i>.&nbsp; I had heard there were gypsies in Russian
cities, and expected to find them like the <i>k&eacute;rengri</i> of
England or Germany,&mdash;house-dwellers somewhat reformed from
vagabondage, but still reckless semi-outlaws, full of tricks and lies; in a
word, <i>gypsies</i>, as the world understands the term.&nbsp; And I
certainly anticipated in Russia something <i>queer</i>,&mdash;the gentleman
who speaks Romany seldom fails to achieve at least that, whenever he gets
into an unbroken haunt, an unhunted forest, where the Romany rye is
unknown,&mdash;but nothing like what I really found.&nbsp; A recent writer
on Russia <a name="citation26"></a><a href="#footnote26"
class="citation">[26]</a> speaks with great contempt of these musical
Romanys, their girls attired in dresses by Worth, as compared with the free
wild outlaws of the steppes, who, with dark, ineffable glances, meaning
nothing more than a wild-cat&rsquo;s, steal poultry, and who, wrapped in
dirty sheep-skins, proudly call themselves <i>Mi dvorane Polaivii</i>,
Lords of the Waste.&nbsp; The gypsies of Moscow, who appeared to me the
most interesting I have ever met, because most remote from the Surrey
ideal, seemed to Mr. Johnstone to be a kind of second-rate Romanys <!--
page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>or
gypsies, gypsified for exhibition, like Mr. Barnum&rsquo;s negro minstrel,
who, though black as a coal by nature, was requested to put on burnt cork
and a wig, that the audience might realize that they were getting a
thoroughly good imitation.&nbsp; Mr. Johnstone&rsquo;s own words are that a
gypsy maiden in a long <i>queue</i>, &ldquo;which perhaps came from
Worth,&rdquo; is &ldquo;horrible,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>corruptio optimi pessima
est</i>;&rdquo; and he further compares such a damsel to a negro with a
cocked hat and spurs.&nbsp; As the only negro thus arrayed who presents
himself to my memory was one who lay dead on the battle-field in Tennessee,
after one of the bravest resistances in history, and in which he and his
men, not having moved, were extended in &ldquo;stark, serried lines&rdquo;
(&ldquo;ten cart-loads of dead niggers,&rdquo; said a man to me who helped
to bury them), I may be excused for not seeing the wit of the
comparison.&nbsp; As for the gypsies of Moscow, I can only say that, after
meeting them in public, and penetrating to their homes, where I was
received as one of themselves, even as a Romany, I found that this opinion
of them was erroneous, and that they were altogether original in spite of
being clean, deeply interesting although honest, and a quite attractive
class in most respects, notwithstanding their ability to read and
write.&nbsp; Against Mr. Johnstone&rsquo;s impressions, I may set the
straightforward and simple result of the experiences of Mr. W. R.
Ralston.&nbsp; &ldquo;The gypsies of Moscow,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;are
justly celebrated for their picturesqueness and for their wonderful
capacity for music.&nbsp; All who have heard their women sing are
enthusiastic about the weird witchery of the performance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I arrived in St. Petersburg, one of my first <!-- page 28--><a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>inquiries was for
gypsies.&nbsp; To my astonishment, they were hard to find.&nbsp; They are
not allowed to live in the city; and I was told that the correct and proper
way to see them would be to go at night to certain <i>caf&eacute;s</i>,
half an hour&rsquo;s sleigh-ride from the town, and listen to their
concerts.&nbsp; What I wanted, however, was not a concert, but a
conversation; not gypsies on exhibition, but gypsies at home,&mdash;and
everybody seemed to be of the opinion that those of &ldquo;Samarcand&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Dorot&rdquo; were entirely got up for effect.&nbsp; In fact, I
heard the opinion hazarded that, even if they spoke Romany, I might depend
upon it they had acquired it simply to deceive.&nbsp; One gentleman, who
had, however, been much with them in other days, assured me that they were
of pure blood, and had an inherited language of their own.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I am sure you will not understand
it.&nbsp; You may be able to talk with those in England, but not with ours,
because there is not a single word in their language which resembles
anything in English, German, French, Latin, Greek, or Italian.&nbsp; I can
only recall,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;one phrase.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
what it means, and I think it will puzzle you.&nbsp; It is <i>me
kam&#257;va tut</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If I experienced internal laughter at hearing this it was for a good
reason, which I can illustrate by an anecdote: &ldquo;I have often
observed, when I lived in China,&rdquo; said Mr. Hoffman Atkinson, author
of &ldquo;A Vocabulary of the Yokohama Dialect,&rdquo; &ldquo;that most
young men, particularly the gay and handsome ones, generally asked me,
about the third day after their arrival in the country, the meaning of the
Pidgin-English phrase, &lsquo;You makee too muchee
lov-lov-pidgin.&rsquo;&nbsp; Investigation always established the fact that
<!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>the
inquirer had heard it from &lsquo;a pretty China girl.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now
<i>lov-pidgin</i> means love, and <i>me kam&#257;va tut</i> is perfectly
good gypsy anywhere for &lsquo;I love you;&rsquo; and a very soft
expression it is, recalling <i>kama-deva</i>, the Indian Cupid, whose bow
is strung with bees, and whose name has two strings to it, since it means,
both in gypsy and Sanskrit, Love-God, or the god of love.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s <i>k&#257;ma-duvel</i>, you know, <i>rya</i>, if you put
it as it ought to be,&rsquo; said Old Windsor Froggie to me once;
&lsquo;but I think that K&#257;ma-<i>devil</i> would by rights come nearer
to it, if Cupid is what you mean.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I referred the gypsy difficulty to a Russian gentleman of high position,
to whose kindness I had been greatly indebted while in St.
Petersburg.&nbsp; He laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me to-morrow night to the <i>caf&eacute;s</i>, and see
the gypsies; I know them well, and can promise that you shall talk with
them as much as you like.&nbsp; Once, in Moscow, I got together all in the
town&mdash;perhaps a hundred and fifty&mdash;to entertain the American
minister, Curtin.&nbsp; That was a very hard thing to do,&mdash;there was
so much professional jealousy among them, and so many quarrels.&nbsp; Would
you have believed it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought of the feuds between sundry sturdy Romanys in England, and
felt that I could suppose such a thing, without dangerously stretching my
faith, and I began to believe in Russian gypsies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I shall call for you to-morrow night with a
<i>troika</i>; I will come early,&mdash;at ten.&nbsp; They never begin to
sing before company arrive at eleven, so that you will have half an hour to
talk to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is on record that the day on which the general gave me this kind
invitation was the coldest known <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>in St. Petersburg for thirty years, the
thermometer having stood, or rather having lain down and groveled that
morning at 40&deg; below zero, Fahr.&nbsp; At the appointed hour the
<i>troika</i>, or three-horse sleigh, was before the H&ocirc;tel
d&rsquo;Europe.&nbsp; It was, indeed, an arctic night, but, well wrapped in
fur-lined <i>shubas</i>, with immense capes which fall to the elbow or rise
far above the head, as required, and wearing fur caps and fur-lined gloves,
we felt no cold.&nbsp; The beard of our <i>istvostshik</i>, or driver, was
a great mass of ice, giving him the appearance of an exceedingly hoary
youth, and his small horses, being very shaggy and thoroughly frosted,
looked in the darkness like immense polar bears.&nbsp; If the general and
myself could only have been considered as gifts of the slightest value to
anybody, I should have regarded our turn-out, with the driver in his
sheep-skin coat, as coming within a miracle of resemblance to that of Santa
Claus, the American Father Christmas.</p>
<p>On, at a tremendous pace, over the snow, which gave out under our
runners that crunching, iron sound only heard when the thermometer touches
zero.&nbsp; There is a peculiar fascination about the <i>troika</i>, and
the sweetest, saddest melody and most plaintive song of Russia belong to
it.</p>
<h3>THE TROIKA.</h3>
<p><i>Vot y&rsquo;dit troika udalaiya</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hear ye the troika-bell a-ringing,<br />
&nbsp;  And see the peasant driver there?<br />
Hear ye the mournful song he&rsquo;s singing,<br />
&nbsp;  Like distant tolling through the air?</p>
<p>&ldquo;O eyes, blue eyes, to me so lonely,<br />
&nbsp;  O eyes&mdash;alas!&mdash;ye give me pain;<br />
<!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>O
eyes, that once looked at me only,<br />
&nbsp;  I ne&rsquo;er shall see your like again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell, my darling, now in heaven,<br />
&nbsp;  And still the heaven of my soul;<br />
Farewell, thou father town, O Moscow,<br />
&nbsp;  Where I have left my life, my all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And ever at the rein still straining,<br />
&nbsp;  One backward glance the driver gave;<br />
Sees but once more a green low hillock,<br />
&nbsp;  Sees but once more his loved one&rsquo;s grave.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Stoi</i>!&rdquo;&mdash;Halt!&nbsp; We stopped at a
stylish-looking building, entered a hall, left our <i>skubas</i>, and I
heard the general ask, &ldquo;Are the gypsies here?&rdquo;&nbsp; An
affirmative being given, we entered a large room, and there, sure enough,
stood six or eight girls and two men, all very well dressed, and all
unmistakably Romany, though smaller and of much slighter or more delicate
frame than the powerful gypsy &ldquo;travelers&rdquo; of England.&nbsp; In
an instant every pair of great, wild eyes was fixed on me.&nbsp; The
general was in every way a more striking figure, but I was manifestly a
fresh stranger, who knew nothing of the country, and certainly nothing of
gypsies or gypsydom.&nbsp; Such a verdant visitor is always most
interesting.&nbsp; It was not by any means my first reception of the kind,
and, as I reviewed at a glance the whole party, I said within
myself:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait an instant, you black snakes, and I will give you something
to make you stare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This promise I kept, when a young man, who looked like a handsome light
Hindoo, stepped up and addressed me in Russian.&nbsp; I looked long and
steadily at him before I spoke, and then said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Latcho divvus prala</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; (Good day, brother.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is <i>that</i>?&rdquo; he exclaimed, startled.</p>
<p><!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>&ldquo;<i>Tu jines latcho adosta</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; (You know very
well.)&nbsp; And then, with the expression in his face of a man who has
been familiarly addressed by a brazen statue, or asked by a new-born babe,
&ldquo;What o&rsquo;clock is it?&rdquo; but with great joy, he
cried:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Romanichal</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an instant they were all around me, marveling greatly, and earnestly
expressing their marvel, at what new species of gypsy I might be; being in
this quite unlike those of England, who, even when they are astonished
&ldquo;out of their senses&rdquo; at being addressed in Romany by a
gentleman, make the most red-Indian efforts to conceal their
amazement.&nbsp; But I speedily found that these Russian gypsies were as
unaffected and child-like as they were gentle in manner, and that they
compared with our own prize-fighting, sturdy-begging, always-suspecting
Romany roughs and <i>rufianas</i> as a delicate greyhound might compare
with a very shrewd old bull-dog, trained by an unusually &ldquo;fly&rdquo;
tramp.</p>
<p>That the girls were first to the fore in questioning me will be doubted
by no one.&nbsp; But we had great trouble in effecting a mutual
understanding.&nbsp; Their Romany was full of Russian; their pronunciation
puzzled me; they &ldquo;bit off their words,&rdquo; and used many in a
strange or false sense.&nbsp; Yet, notwithstanding this, I contrived to
converse pretty readily with the men,&mdash;very readily with the captain,
a man as dark as Ben Lee, to those who know Benjamin, or as mahogany, to
those who know him not.&nbsp; But with the women it was very difficult to
converse.&nbsp; There is a theory current that women have a specialty of
tact and readiness in understanding a foreigner, or in making themselves
understood; it may be so with <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>cultivated ladies, but it is my experience
that, among the uneducated, men have a monopoly of such quick
intelligence.&nbsp; In order fully to convince them that we really had a
tongue in common, I repeated perhaps a hundred nouns, giving, for instance,
the names of various parts of the body, of articles of apparel and objects
in the room, and I believe that we did not find a single word which, when
pronounced distinctly by itself, was not intelligible to us all.&nbsp; I
had left in London a Russo-Romany vocabulary, once published in &ldquo;The
Asiatic Magazine,&rdquo; and I had met with B&ouml;htlinghk&rsquo;s article
on the dialect, as well as specimens of it in the works of Pott and
Miklosich, but had unfortunately learned nothing of it from them.&nbsp; I
soon found, however, that I knew a great many more gypsy words than did my
new friends, and that our English Romany far excels the Russian in <i>copia
verborum</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must sit down.&rdquo;&nbsp; I observed on this and other
occasions that Russian gypsies are very na&iuml;f.&nbsp; And as it is in
human nature to prefer sitting by a pretty girl, these Slavonian Romanys so
arrange it according to the principles of natural selection&mdash;or
natural politeness&mdash;that, when a stranger is in their gates, the two
prettiest girls in their possession sit at his right and left, the two less
attractive next again, <i>et seriatim</i>.&nbsp; So at once a damsel of
comely mien, arrayed in black silk attire, of faultless elegance, cried to
me, pointing to a chair by her side, &ldquo;<i>Bersh tu alay</i>,
<i>rya</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; (Sit down, sir),&mdash;a phrase which would be
perfectly intelligible to any Romany in England.&nbsp; I admit that there
was another damsel, who is generally regarded by most people as the true
gypsy belle of the party, who did not sit by me.&nbsp; <!-- page 34--><a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>But, as the one who had
&ldquo;voted herself into the chair,&rdquo; by my side, was more to my
liking, being the most intelligent and most gypsy, I had good cause to
rejoice.</p>
<p>I was astonished at the sensible curiosity as to gypsy life in other
lands which was displayed, and at the questions asked.&nbsp; I really doubt
if I ever met with an English gypsy who cared a farthing to know anything
about his race as it exists in foreign countries, or whence it came.&nbsp;
Once, and once only, I thought I had interested White George, at East
Moulsey, in an account of Egypt, and the small number of Romanys there; but
his only question was to the effect that, if there were so few gypsies in
Egypt, wouldn&rsquo;t it be a good place for him to go to sell
baskets?&nbsp; These of Russia, however, asked all kinds of questions about
the manners and customs of their congeners, and were pleased when they
recognized familiar traits.&nbsp; And every gypsyism, whether of word or
way, was greeted with delighted laughter.&nbsp; In one thing I noted a
radical difference between these gypsies and those of the rest of Europe
and of America.&nbsp; There was none of that continually assumed mystery
and Romany freemasonry, of superior occult knowledge and &ldquo;deep&rdquo;
information, which is often carried to the depths of absurdity and to the
height of humbug.&nbsp; I say this advisedly, since, however much it may
give charm to a novel or play, it is a serious impediment to a
philologist.&nbsp; Let me give an illustration.</p>
<p>Once, during the evening, these Russian gypsies were anxious to know if
there were any books in their language.&nbsp; Now I have no doubt that Dr.
Bath Smart, or Prof. E. H. Palmer, or any other of the <!-- page 35--><a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>initiated, will
perfectly understand when I say that by mere force of habit I shivered and
evaded the question.&nbsp; When a gentleman who manifests a knowledge of
Romany among gypsies in England is suspected of &ldquo;dixonary&rdquo;
studies, it amounts to <i>lasciate ogni speranza</i>,&mdash;give up all
hope of learning any more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you here, <i>rya</i>, in my tent,&rdquo;
said the before-mentioned Ben Lee to me one night, in camp near Weybridge,
&ldquo;because I&rsquo;ve heard, and I know, you didn&rsquo;t pick up
<i>your</i> Romany out of books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The silly dread, the hatred, the childish antipathy, real or affected,
but always ridiculous, which is felt in England, not only among gypsies,
but even by many gentlemen scholars, to having the Romany language
published is indescribable.&nbsp; Vamb&eacute;ry was not more averse to
show a lead pencil among Tartars than I am to take notes of words among
strange English gypsies.&nbsp; I might have spared myself any annoyance
from such a source among the Russian Romanys.&nbsp; They had not heard of
Mr. George Borrow; nor were there ugly stories current among them to the
effect that Dr. Smart and Prof. E. H. Palmer had published works, the
direct result of which would be to facilitate their little paths to the
jail, the gallows, and the grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would we hear some singing?&rdquo;&nbsp; We were ready, and for
the first time in my life I listened to the long-anticipated, far-famed
magical melody of Russian gypsies.&nbsp; And what was it like?&nbsp; May I
preface my reply to the reader with the remark that there are, roughly
speaking, two kinds of music in the world,&mdash;the wild and the
tame,&mdash;and the rarest of human <!-- page 36--><a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>beings is he who can
appreciate both.&nbsp; Only one such man ever wrote a book, and his
<i>nomen et omen</i> is Engel, like that of the little English slaves who
were <i>non Angli</i>, <i>sed angeli</i>.&nbsp; I have in my time been
deeply moved by the choruses of Nubian boatmen; I have listened with great
pleasure to Chinese and Japanese music,&mdash;Ole Bull once told me he had
done the same; I have delighted by the hour in Arab songs; and I have felt
the charm of our red-Indian music.&nbsp; If this seems absurd to those who
characterize all such sound and song as &ldquo;caterwauling,&rdquo; let me
remind the reader that in all Europe there is not one man fonder of music
than an average Arab, a Chinese, or a red Indian; for any of these people,
as I have seen and know, will sit twelve or fifteen hours, without the
least weariness, listening to what cultivated Europeans all consider as a
mere charivari.&nbsp; When London gladly endures fifteen-hour concerts,
composed of <i>morceaux</i> by Wagner, Chopin, and Liszt, I will believe
that art can charm as much as nature.</p>
<p>The medium point of intelligence in this puzzle may be found in the
extraordinary fascination which many find in the monotonous tum-tum of the
banjo, and which reappears, somewhat refined, or at least somewhat
Frenchified, in the <i>Bamboula</i> and other Creole airs.&nbsp; Thence, in
an ascending series, but connected with it, we have old Spanish melodies,
then the Arabic, and here we finally cross the threshold into mystery,
midnight, and &ldquo;caterwauling.&rdquo;&nbsp; I do not know that I can
explain the fact why the more &ldquo;barbarous&rdquo; music is, the more it
is beloved of man; but I think that the principle of the <i>refrain</i>, or
repetition in music, which as yet governs all decorative art and which Mr.
Whistler and others are endeavoring <!-- page 37--><a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>desperately to destroy,
acts in music as a sort of animal magnetism or abstraction, ending in an
<i>extase</i>.&nbsp; As for the fascination which such wild melodies exert,
it is beyond description.&nbsp; The most enraptured audience I ever saw in
my life was at a Coptic wedding in Cairo, where one hundred and fifty
guests listened, from seven <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> till three
<span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, and Heaven knows how much later, to what a
European would call absolute jangling, yelping, and howling.</p>
<p>The real medium, however, between what I have, for want of better words,
called wild and tame music exists only in that of the Russian
gypsies.&nbsp; These artists, with wonderful tact and untaught skill, have
succeeded, in all their songs, in combining the mysterious and maddening
charm of the true, wild Eastern music with that of regular and simple
melody, intelligible to every Western ear.&nbsp; I have never listened to
the singing or playing of any distinguished artist&mdash;and certainly
never of any far-famed amateur&mdash;without realizing that neither words
nor melody was of the least importance, but that the man&rsquo;s manner of
performance or display was everything.&nbsp; Now, in enjoying gypsy
singing, one feels at once as if the vocalists had entirely forgotten self,
and were carried away by the bewildering beauty of the air and the charm of
the words.&nbsp; There is no self-consciousness, no vanity,&mdash;all is
real.&nbsp; The listener feels as if he were a performer; the performer is
an enraptured listener.&nbsp; There is no soulless &ldquo;art for the sake
of art,&rdquo; but art for direct pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We intend to sing only Romany for <i>you</i>, <i>rya</i>,&rdquo;
said the young lady to my left, &ldquo;and you will hear our real gypsy
airs.&nbsp; The <i>Gaji</i> [Russians] often ask for songs in our language,
and don&rsquo;t get them.&nbsp; But <!-- page 38--><a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>you are a Romanichal,
and when you go home, far over the <i>baro k&#257;lo p&#257;ni</i> [the
broad black water, that is, the ocean], you shall tell the Romany how we
can sing.&nbsp; Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I listened to the strangest, wildest, and sweetest singing I ever
had heard,&mdash;the singing of Lurleis, of sirens, of witches.&nbsp;
First, one damsel, with an exquisitely clear, firm voice, began to sing a
verse of a love-ballad, and as it approached the end the chorus stole in,
softly and unperceived, but with exquisite skill, until, in a few seconds,
the summer breeze, murmuring melody over a rippling lake, seemed changed to
a midnight tempest, roaring over a stormy sea, in which the <i>basso</i> of
the <i>k&#257;lo shureskro</i> (the black captain) pealed like
thunder.&nbsp; Just as it died away a second girl took up the melody, very
sweetly, but with a little more excitement,&mdash;it was like a gleam of
moonlight on the still agitated waters, a strange contralto witch-gleam;
and then again the chorus and the storm; and then another solo yet sweeter,
sadder, and stranger,&mdash;the movement continually increasing, until all
was fast, and wild, and mad,&mdash;a locomotive quickstep, and then a
sudden silence&mdash;sunlight&mdash;the storm had blown away.</p>
<p>Nothing on earth is so like magic and elfin-work as when women burst
forth into improvised melody.&nbsp; The bird only &ldquo;sings as his bill
grew,&rdquo; or what he learned from the elders; yet when you hear birds
singing in woodland green, throwing out to God or the fairies irrepressible
floods of what seems like audible sunshine, so well does it match with
summer&rsquo;s light, you think it is wonderful.&nbsp; It is mostly when
you forget the long training of the prima donna, in her ease and apparent
naturalness, that her song is <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>sweetest.&nbsp; But there is a charm, which was
well known of old, though we know it not to-day, which was practiced by the
bards and believed in by their historians.&nbsp; It was the feeling that
the song was born of the moment; that it came with the air, gushing and
fresh from the soul.&nbsp; In reading the strange stories of the
professional bards and scalds and minstrels of the early Middle Age, one is
constantly bewildered at the feats of off-hand composition which were
exacted of the poets among Celts or Norsemen.&nbsp; And it is evident
enough that in some mysterious way these singers knew how to put strange
pressure on the Muse, and squeeze strains out of her in a manner which
would have been impossible at present.</p>
<p>Yet it lingers here and there on earth among wild, strange
people,&mdash;this art of making melody at will.&nbsp; I first heard it
among Nubian boatmen on the Nile.&nbsp; It was as manifest that it was
composed during the making as that the singers were unconscious of their
power.&nbsp; One sung at first what may have been a well-known verse.&nbsp;
While singing, another voice stole in, and yet another, softly as shadows
steal into twilight; and ere I knew it all were in a great chorus, which
fell away as mysteriously, to become duos, trios,&mdash;changing in melody
in strange, sweet, fitful wise, as the faces seen in the golden cloud in
the visioned aureole of God blend, separate, burn, and fade away ever into
fresher glory and tints incarnadined.</p>
<p>Miss C. F. Gordon Cumming, after informing us that &ldquo;it is utterly
impossible to give you the faintest shadow of an idea of the fascination of
Tahitian <i>him&eacute;nes</i>,&rdquo; proceeds, as men in general and
women in particular invariably do, to give what the writer <!-- page
40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>really believes
is a very good description indeed.&nbsp; &rsquo;T is ever thus, and thus
&rsquo;t will ever be, and the description of these songs is so good that
any person gifted with imagination or poetry cannot fail to smile at the
preceding disavowal of her ability to give an idea.</p>
<p>These <i>him&eacute;nes</i> are not&mdash;and here such of my too
expectant young lady-readers as are careless in spelling will be sadly
disappointed&mdash;in any way connected with weddings.&nbsp; They are
simply the natural music of Tahiti, or strange and beautiful
part-songs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing you have ever heard in any other
country,&rdquo; says our writer, &ldquo;bears the slightest resemblance to
these wild, exquisite glees, faultless in time and harmony, though
apparently each singer introduces any variations which may occur to him or
to her.&nbsp; Very often there is no leader, and apparently all sing
according to their own sweet will.&nbsp; One voice commences; it may be
that of an old native, with genuine native words (the meaning of which we
had better not inquire), or it may be with a Scriptural story, versified
and sung to an air originally from Europe, but so completely Tahitianized
that no mortal could recognize it, which is all in its favor, for the wild
melodies of this isle are beyond measure fascinating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After one clause of solo, another strikes in&mdash;here, there,
everywhere&mdash;in harmonious chorus.&nbsp; It seems as if one section
devoted themselves to pouring forth a rippling torrent of &lsquo;Ra, ra,
ra&mdash;ra&mdash;ra!&rsquo; while others burst into a flood of &lsquo;La,
la&mdash;la&mdash;la&mdash;la!&rsquo;&nbsp; Some confine their care to
sound a deep, booming bass in a long-continued drone, somewhat suggestive
(to my appreciative Highland ear) of our own bagpipes.&nbsp; Here and there
high falsetto notes <!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>strike in, varied from verse to verse, and then
the choruses of La and Ra come bubbling in liquid melody, while the voices
of the principal singers now join in unison, now diverge as widely as it is
possible for them to do, but all combine to produce the quaintest, most
melodious, rippling glee that ever was heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the <i>him&eacute;ne</i>; such the singing which I heard in
Egypt in a more regular form; but it was exactly as the writer so admirably
sets it forth (and your description, my lady traveler, is, despite your
disavowal, quite perfect and a <i>him&eacute;ne</i> of itself) that I heard
the gypsy girls of St. Petersburg and of Moscow sing.&nbsp; For, after a
time, becoming jolly as flies, first one voice began with &ldquo;La, la,
la&mdash;la&mdash;la!&rdquo; to an unnamed, unnamable, charming melody,
into which went and came other voices, some bringing one verse or no verse,
in unison or alone, the least expected doing what was most awaited, which
was to surprise us and call forth gay peals of happy laughter, while the
&ldquo;La, la, la&mdash;la&mdash;la!&rdquo; was kept up continuously, like
an accompaniment.&nbsp; And still the voices, basso, soprano, tenor,
baritone, contralto, rose and fell, the moment&rsquo;s inspiration telling
how, till at last all blended in a locomotive-paced La, and in a final roar
of laughter it ended.</p>
<p>I could not realize at the time how much this exquisite part-singing was
extemporized.&nbsp; The sound of it rung in my head&mdash;I assure you,
reader, it rings there yet when I think of it&mdash;like a magic
bell.&nbsp; Another day, however, when I begged for a repetition of it, the
girls could recall nothing of it.&nbsp; They could start it again on any
air to the unending strain of &ldquo;La&mdash;la&mdash;la;&rdquo; but
<i>the</i> &ldquo;La&mdash;la&mdash;la&rdquo; of the <!-- page 42--><a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>previous evening was
<i>avec les neiges d&rsquo;antan</i>, with the smoke of yesterday&rsquo;s
fire, with the perfume and bird-songs.&nbsp; &ldquo;La, la,
la&mdash;la&mdash;la!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Arab singing, such effects are applied simply to set forth
erotomania; in negro minstrelsy, they are degraded to the lowest humor; in
higher European music, when employed, they simply illustrate the skill of
composer and musician.&nbsp; The spirit of gypsy singing recalled by its
method and sweetness that of the Nubian boatmen, but in its <i>general</i>
effect I could think only of those strange fits of excitement which thrill
the red Indian and make him burst into song.&nbsp; The Abb&eacute; Domenech
<a name="citation42"></a><a href="#footnote42" class="citation">[42]</a>
has observed that the American savage pays attention to every sound that
strikes upon his ear when the leaves, softly shaken by the evening breeze,
seem to sigh through the air, or when the tempest, bursting forth with
fury, shakes the gigantic trees that crack like reeds.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
chirping of the birds, the cry of the wild beasts, in a word, all those
sweet, grave, or imposing voices that animate the wilderness, are so many
musical lessons, which he easily remembers.&rdquo;&nbsp; In illustration of
this, the missionary describes the singing of a Chippewa chief, and its
wild inspiration, in a manner which vividly illustrates all music of the
class of which I write.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;during one of those long winter
nights, so monotonous and so wearisome in the woods.&nbsp; We were in a
wigwam, which afforded us but miserable shelter from the inclemency of the
season.&nbsp; The storm raged without; the tempest roared in the open
country; the wind blew with violence, and whistled through the fissures of
the cabin; the rain fell in torrents, and prevented us from continuing <!--
page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>our
route.&nbsp; Our host was an Indian, with sparkling and intelligent eyes,
clad with a certain elegance, and wrapped majestically in a large fur
cloak.&nbsp; Seated close to the fire, which cast a reddish gleam through
the interior of his wigwam, he felt himself all at once seized with an
irresistible desire to imitate the convulsions of nature, and to sing his
impressions.&nbsp; So, taking hold of a drum which hung near his bed, he
beat a slight rolling, resembling the distant sounds of an approaching
storm; then, raising his voice to a shrill treble, which he knew how to
soften when he pleased, he imitated the whistling of the air, the creaking
of the branches dashing against one another, and the particular noise
produced by dead leaves when accumulated in compact masses on the
ground.&nbsp; By degrees the rollings of the drum became more frequent and
louder, the chants more sonorous and shrill, and at last our Indian
shrieked, howled, and roared in a most frightful manner; he struggled and
struck his instrument with extraordinary rapidity.&nbsp; It was a real
tempest, to which nothing was wanting, not even the distant howling of the
dogs, nor the bellowing of the affrighted buffaloes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have observed the same musical inspiration of a storm upon Arabs, who,
during their singing, also accompanied themselves on a drum.&nbsp; I once
spent two weeks in a Mediterranean steamboat, on board of which were more
than two hundred pilgrims, for the greater part wild Bedouins, going to
Mecca.&nbsp; They had a minstrel who sang and played on the
<i>darabuka</i>, or earthenware drum, and he was aided by another with a
simple <i>nai</i>, or reed-whistle; the same orchestra, in fact, which is
in universal use among all red Indians.&nbsp; To these performers the
pilgrims listened <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>with indescribable pleasure; and I soon found
that they regarded me favorably because I did the same, being, of course,
the only Frank on board who paid any attention to the singing&mdash;or any
money for it.&nbsp; But it was at night and during storms that the spirit
of music always seemed to be strongest on the Arabs, and then, amid roaring
of wild waters and thundering, and in dense darkness, the rolling of the
drum and the strange, bewildering ballads never ceased.&nbsp; It was the
very counterpart, in all respects, of the Chippewa storm song.</p>
<p>After the first gypsy lyric there came another, to which the captain
especially directed my attention as being what Sam Petulengro calls
&ldquo;reg&rsquo;lar Romany.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was <i>I rakli adro o lolo
gad</i> (The girl in the red chemise), as well as I can recall his
words,&mdash;a very sweet song, with a simple but spirited chorus; and as
the sympathetic electricity of excitement seized the performers we were all
in a minute &ldquo;going down the rapids in a spring freshet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bagan tu rya</i>, <i>bagan</i>!&rdquo; (Sing, sir,&mdash;sing)
cried my handsome neighbor, with her black gypsy eyes sparkling fire.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Jines hi bagan eto</i>&mdash;<i>eto latcho
Romanes</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; (You can sing that,&mdash;it&rsquo;s real
Romany.)&nbsp; It was evident that she and all were singing with thorough
enjoyment, and with a full and realizing consciousness of gypsyism, being
greatly stimulated by my presence and sympathy.&nbsp; I felt that the
gypsies were taking unusual pains to please the Romany rye from the
<i>dur&rsquo; tem</i>, or far country, and they had attained the acme of
success by being thoroughly delighted with themselves, which is all that
can be hoped for in art, where the aim is pleasure and not criticism.</p>
<p><!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>There was a pause in the performance, but none in the chattering
of the young ladies, and during this a curious little incident
occurred.&nbsp; Wishing to know if my pretty friend could understand an
English gypsy lyric, I sang in an undertone a ballad, taken from George
Borrow&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; and which begins with these
words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Pende Eomani chai ke laki dye;<br />
&lsquo;Miri diri dye, mi shom k&#257;meli.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I never knew whether this was really an old gypsy poem or one written by
Mr. Borrow.&nbsp; Once, when I repeated it to old Henry James, as he sat
making baskets, I was silenced by being told, &ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t no
real gypsy <i>gilli</i>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s one of the kind made up by
gentlemen and ladies.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, as soon as I repeated it, the
Russian gypsy girl cried eagerly, &ldquo;I know that song!&rdquo; and
actually sang me a ballad which was essentially the same, in which a damsel
describes her fall, owing to a Gajo (Gorgio, a Gentile,&mdash;not gypsy)
lover, and her final expulsion from the tent.&nbsp; It was adapted to a
very pretty melody, and as soon as she had sung it, <i>sotto voce</i>, my
pretty friend exclaimed to another girl, &ldquo;Only think, the <i>rye</i>
from America knows <i>that</i> song!&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, as many centuries
must have passed since the English and Russian gypsies parted from the
parent stock, the preservation of this song is very remarkable, and its
antiquity must be very great.&nbsp; I did not take it down, but any
resident in St. Petersburg can, if so inclined, do so among the gypsies at
Dorat, and verify my statement.</p>
<p>Then there was a pretty dance, of a modified Oriental character, by one
of the damsels.&nbsp; For this, as for the singing, the only musical
instrument used was <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>a guitar, which had seven strings, tuned in
Spanish fashion, and was rather weak in tone.&nbsp; I wished it had been a
powerful Panormo, which would have exactly suited the <i>timbre</i> of
these voices.&nbsp; The gypsies were honestly interested in all I could
tell them about their kind in other lands; while the girls were
professionally desirous to hear more Anglo-Romany songs, and were
particularly pleased with one beginning with the words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Me shom akonyo,&rsquo; gildas yoi,<br />
&nbsp;  Men b&#363;ti ruzhior,<br />
Te s&#257;r i chiriclia adoi<br />
&nbsp;  Pen mengy gilior.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though we &ldquo;got on&rdquo; after a manner in our Romany talk, I was
often obliged to have recourse to my friend the general to translate long
sentences into Russian, especially when some sand-bar of a verb or some log
of a noun impeded the current of our conversation.&nbsp; Finally, a formal
request was made by the captain that I would, as one deep beyond all their
experience in Romany matters, kindly tell them what kind of people they
really were, and whence they came.&nbsp; With this demand I cheerfully
complied, every word being listened to with breathless interest.&nbsp; So I
told them what I knew or had conjectured relative to their Indian origin:
how their fathers had wandered forth through Persia; how their travels
could be traced by the Persian, Greek, or Roumanian words in the language;
how in 1417 a band of them appeared in Europe, led by a few men of great
diplomatic skill, who, by crafty dealing, obtained from the Pope, the
Emperor of Germany, and all the kings of Europe, except that of England,
permission to wander for fifty years as pilgrims, declaring that they <!--
page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>had been
Christians, but, having become renegades, the King of Hungary had imposed a
penance on them of half a century&rsquo;s exile.&nbsp; Then I informed them
that precisely the same story had been told by them to the rulers in Syria
and Egypt, only that in the Mohammedan countries they pretended to be good
followers of Islam.&nbsp; I said there was reason to believe that some of
their people had been in Poland and the other Slavonic countries ever since
the eleventh century, but that those of England must have gone directly
from Eastern Europe to Great Britain; for, although they had many Slavic
words, such as <i>krallis</i> (king) and <i>shuba</i>, there were no French
terms, and very few traces of German or Italian, in the English
dialect.&nbsp; I observed that the men all understood the geographical
allusions which I made, knowing apparently where India, Persia, and Egypt
were situated&mdash;a remarkable contrast to our own English
&ldquo;travelers,&rdquo; one of whom once informed me that he would like to
go &ldquo;on the road&rdquo; in America, &ldquo;because you know, sir, as
America lays along into France, we could get our French baskets cheaper
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I found, on inquiry, that the Russian gypsies profess Christianity; but,
as the religion of the Greek church, as I saw it, appears to be practically
something very little better than fetich-worship, I cannot exalt them as
models of evangelical piety.&nbsp; They are, however, according to a
popular proverb, not far from godliness in being very clean in their
persons; and not only did they appear so to me, but I was assured by
several Russians that, as regarded these singing gypsies, it was invariably
the case.&nbsp; As for morality in gypsy girls, their principles are very
peculiar.&nbsp; <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>Not a whisper of scandal attaches to these
Russian Romany women as regards transient amours.&nbsp; But if a wealthy
Russian gentleman falls in love with one, and will have and hold her
permanently, or for a durable connection, he may take her to his home if
she likes him, but must pay monthly a sum into the gypsy treasury; for
these people apparently form an <i>artel</i>, or society-union, like all
other classes of Russians.&nbsp; It may be suggested, as an explanation of
this apparent incongruity, that gypsies all the world over regard steady
cohabitation, or agreement, as marriage, binding themselves, as it were, by
<i>Gand-harbavivaha</i>, as the saint married Vasantasena, which is an old
Sanskrit way of wedding.&nbsp; And let me remark that if one tenth of what
I heard in Russia about &ldquo;morals&rdquo; in the highest or lowest or
any other class be true, the gypsies of that country are shining lights and
brilliant exemplars of morality to all by whom they are surrounded.&nbsp;
Let me also add that never on any occasion did I hear or see among them
anything in the slightest degree improper or unrefined.&nbsp; I knew very
well that I could, if I chose, talk to such <i>na&iuml;ve</i> people about
subjects which would shock an English lady, and, as the reader may
remember, I did quote Mr. Borrow&rsquo;s song, which he has not
translated.&nbsp; But a European girl who would have endured allusions to
tabooed subjects would have at all times shown vulgarity or coarseness,
while these Russian Romany girls were invariably lady-like.&nbsp; It is
true that the St. Petersburg party had a dissipated air; three or four of
them looked like second-class French or Italian theatrical artistes, and I
should not be astonished to learn that very late hours and champagne were
familiar to them as cigarettes, or that <!-- page 49--><a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>their flirtations among
their own people were neither faint, nor few, nor far between.&nbsp; But
their conduct in my presence was irreproachable.&nbsp; Those of Moscow, in
fact, had not even the apparent defects of their St. Petersburg sisters and
brothers, and when among them it always seemed to me as if I were simply
with nice gentle creoles or Cubans, the gypsy manner being tamed down to
the Spanish level, their great black eyes and their guitars increasing the
resemblance.</p>
<p>The indescribably wild and thrilling character of gypsy music is
thoroughly appreciated by the Russians, who pay very high prices for Romany
performances.&nbsp; From five to eight or ten pounds sterling is usually
given to a dozen gypsies for singing an hour or two to a special party, and
this is sometimes repeated twice or thrice of an evening.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
Russian gentleman, when he is in funds,&rdquo; said the clerk of the
Slavansky Bazaar in Moscow to me, &ldquo;will make nothing of giving the
Zigani a hundred-ruble note,&rdquo; the ruble rating at half a crown.&nbsp;
The result is that good singers among these lucky Romanys are well to do,
and lead soft lives, for Russia.</p>
<h3>MOSCOW.</h3>
<p>I had no friends in Moscow to direct me where to find gypsies <i>en
famille</i>, and the inquiries which I made of chance acquaintances simply
convinced me that the world at large was as ignorant of their ways as it
was prejudiced against them.&nbsp; At last the good-natured old porter of
our hotel told me, in his rough Baltic German, how to meet these mysterious
minstrels to advantage.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must take a sleigh,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;and go out to Petrovka.&nbsp; That is a place in <!-- page
50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>the country,
where there are grand <i>caf&eacute;s</i> at considerable distances one
from the other.&nbsp; Pay the driver three rubles for four hours.&nbsp;
Enter a <i>caf&eacute;</i>, call for something to drink, listen to the
gypsies singing, and when they pass round a plate put some money in
it.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was explicit, and at ten
o&rsquo;clock in the evening I hired a sleigh and went.</p>
<p>If the cold which I had experienced in the general&rsquo;s troika in St.
Petersburg might be compared to a moderate rheumatism, that which I
encountered in the sleigh outside the walls of Moscow, on Christmas Eve,
1876, was like a fierce gout.&nbsp; The ride was in all conscience Russian
enough to have its ending among gypsies, Tartars, or Cossacks.&nbsp; To go
at a headlong pace over the creaking snow behind an <i>istvostshik</i>,
named Vassili, the round, cold moon overhead, church-spires tipped with
great inverted golden turnips in the distance, and this on a night when the
frost seemed almost to scream in its intensity, is as much of a sensation
in the suburbs of Moscow as it could be out on the steppes.&nbsp; A few
wolves, more or less, make no difference,&mdash;and even they come
sometimes within three hours&rsquo; walk of the Kremlin.&nbsp; <i>Et ego
inter lupos</i>,&mdash;I too have been among wolves in my time by night, in
Kansas, and thought nothing of such rides compared to the one I had when I
went gypsying from Moscow.</p>
<p>In half an hour Vassili brought me to a house, which I entered.&nbsp; A
&ldquo;proud porter,&rdquo; a vast creature, in uniform suggestive of
embassies and kings&rsquo; palaces, relieved me of my <i>shuba</i>, and I
found my way into a very large and high hall, brilliantly lighted as if for
a thousand guests, while the only occupants were four couples,
&ldquo;spooning&rdquo; <i>sans g&ecirc;ne</i>, one in each corner <!-- page
51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>and a small
party of men and girls drinking in the middle.&nbsp; I called a waiter; he
spoke nothing but Russian, and Russian is of all languages the most useless
to him who only talks it &ldquo;a little.&rdquo;&nbsp; A little Arabic, or
even a little Chippewa, I have found of great service, but a fair
vocabulary and weeks of study of the grammar are of no avail in a country
where even men of gentlemanly appearance turn away with childish
<i>ennui</i> the instant they detect the foreigner, resolving apparently
that they cannot and <i>will not</i> understand him.&nbsp; In matters like
this the ordinary Russian is more impatient and less intelligent than any
Oriental or even red Indian.&nbsp; The result of my interview with the
waiter was that we were soon involved in the completest misunderstanding on
the subject of gypsies.&nbsp; The question was settled by reference to a
fat and fair damsel, one of the &ldquo;spoons&rdquo; already referred to,
who spoke German.&nbsp; She explained to me that as it was Christmas Eve no
gypsies would be there, or at any other <i>caf&eacute;</i>.&nbsp; This was
disappointing.&nbsp; I called Vassili, and he drove on to another
&ldquo;garden,&rdquo; deeply buried in snow.</p>
<p>When I entered the rooms at this place, I perceived at a glance that
matters had mended.&nbsp; There was the hum of many voices, and a perfume
like that of tea and many <i>papiross</i>, or cigarettes, with a prompt
sense of society and of enjoyment.&nbsp; I was dazzled at first by the
glare of the lights, and could distinguish nothing, unless it was that the
numerous company regarded me with utter amazement; for it was an &ldquo;off
night,&rdquo; when no business was expected,&mdash;few were there save
&ldquo;professionals&rdquo; and their friends,&mdash;and I was manifestly
an unexpected intruder on Bohemia.&nbsp; <!-- page 52--><a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>As luck would have it,
that which I believed was the one worst night in the year to find the gypsy
minstrels proved to be the exceptional occasion when they were all
assembled, and I had hit upon it.&nbsp; Of course this struck me pleasantly
enough as I looked around, for I knew that at a touch the spell would be
broken, and with one word I should have the warmest welcome from all.&nbsp;
I had literally not a single speaking acquaintance within a thousand miles,
and yet here was a room crowded with gay and festive strangers, whom the
slightest utterance would convert into friends.</p>
<p>I was not disappointed.&nbsp; Seeking for an opportunity, I saw a young
man of gentlemanly appearance, well dressed, and with a mild and amiable
air.&nbsp; Speaking to him in German, I asked the very needless question if
there were any gypsies present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wish to hear them sing?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not.&nbsp; I only want to talk with one,&mdash;with
<i>any</i> one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He appeared to be astonished, but, pointing to a handsome, slender young
lady, a very dark brunette, elegantly attired in black silk,
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stepped across to the girl, who rose to meet me.&nbsp; I said nothing
for a few seconds, but looked at her intently, and then asked,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Rakessa tu Romanes</i>, <i>miri pen</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; (Do you
talk Romany, my sister?)</p>
<p>She gave one deep, long glance of utter astonishment, drew one long
breath, and, with a cry of delight and wonder, said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Romanichal</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That word awoke the entire company, and with it <!-- page 53--><a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>they found out who the
intruder was.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then might you hear them cry aloud, &lsquo;The
Moringer is here!&rsquo;&rdquo; for I began to feel like the long-lost lord
returned, so warm was my welcome.&nbsp; They flocked around me; they cried
aloud in Romany, and one good-natured, smiling man, who looked like a
German gypsy, mounting a chair, waved a guitar by its neck high in the air
as a signal of discovery of a great prize to those at a distance, repeating
rapidly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Av&rsquo;akai</i>, <i>ava&rsquo;kai</i>,
<i>Romanichal</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; (Come here; here&rsquo;s a gypsy!)</p>
<p>And they came, dark and light, great and small, and got round me, and
shook hands, and held to my arms, and asked where I came from, and how I
did, and if it wasn&rsquo;t jolly, and what would I take to drink, and said
how glad they were to see me; and when conversation flagged for an instant,
somebody said to his next neighbor, with an air of wisdom, &ldquo;American
Romany,&rdquo; and everybody repeated it with delight.&nbsp; Then it
occurred to the guitarist and the young lady that we had better sit
down.&nbsp; So my first acquaintance and discoverer, whose name was
Liubasha, was placed, in right of pre&euml;mption, at my right hand, the
<i>belle des belles</i>, Miss Sarsha, at my left, a number of damsels all
around these, and then three or four circles of gypsies, of different ages
and tints, standing up, surrounded us all.&nbsp; In the outer ring were
several fast-looking and pretty Russian or German blonde girls, whose
mission it is, I believe, to dance&mdash;and flirt&mdash;with visitors, and
a few gentlemanly-looking Russians, <i>vieuz gar&ccedil;ons</i>, evidently
of the kind who are at home behind the scenes, and who knew where to come
to enjoy themselves.&nbsp; Altogether there must have been about fifty <!--
page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>present,
and I soon observed that every word I uttered was promptly repeated, while
every eye was fixed on me.</p>
<p>I could converse in Romany with the guitarist, and without much
difficulty; but with the charming, heedless young ladies I had as much
trouble to talk as with their sisters in St. Petersburg.&nbsp; The young
gentleman already referred to, to whom in my fancy I promptly gave the
Offenbachian name of Prince Paul, translated whenever there was a
misunderstanding, and in a few minutes we were all intimate.&nbsp; Miss
Sarsha, who had a slight cast in one of her wild black eyes, which added
something to the gypsiness and roguery of her smiles, and who wore in a
ring a large diamond, which seemed as if it might be the right eye in the
wrong place, was what is called an earnest young lady, with plenty to say
and great energy wherewith to say it.&nbsp; What with her eyes, her
diamond, her smiles, and her tongue, she constituted altogether a fine
specimen of irrepressible fireworks, and Prince Paul had enough to do in
facilitating conversation.&nbsp; There was no end to his politeness, but it
was an impossible task for him now and then promptly to carry over a long
sentence from German to Russian, and he would give it up like an invincible
conundrum, with the patient smile and head-wag and hand-wave of an amiable
Dundreary.&nbsp; Yet I began to surmise a mystery even in him.&nbsp; More
than once he inadvertently betrayed a knowledge of Romany, though he
invariably spoke of his friends around in a patronizing manner as
&ldquo;these gypsies.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was very odd, for in appearance he
was a Gorgio of the Gorgios, and did not seem, despite any talent for
languages which he might <!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>possess, likely to trouble himself to acquire
Romany while Russian would answer every purpose of conversation.&nbsp; All
of this was, however, explained to me afterward.</p>
<p>Prince Paul again asked me if I had come out to hear a concert.&nbsp; I
said, &ldquo;No; that I had simply come out to see my brothers and sisters
and talk with them, just as I hoped they would come to see me if I were in
my own country.&rdquo;&nbsp; This speech produced a most favorable
impression, and there was, in a quiet way, a little private conversation
among the leaders, after which Prince Paul said to me, in a very pleasant
manner, that &ldquo;these gypsies,&rdquo; being delighted at the visit from
the gentleman from a distant country, would like to offer me a song in
token of welcome.&nbsp; To this I answered, with many thanks, that such
kindness was more than I had expected, for I was well aware of the great
value of such a compliment from singers whose fame had reached me even in
America.&nbsp; It was evident that my grain of a reply did not fall upon
stony ground, for I never was among people who seemed to be so quickly
impressed by any act of politeness, however trifling.&nbsp; A bow, a grasp
of the hand, a smile, or a glance would gratify them, and this
gratification their lively black eyes expressed in the most unmistakable
manner.</p>
<p>So we had the song, wild and wonderful like all of its kind, given with
that delightful <i>abandon</i> which attains perfection only among
gypsies.&nbsp; I had enjoyed the singing in St. Petersburg, but there was a
<i>laisser aller</i>, a completely gay spirit, in this Christmas-Eve gypsy
party in Moscow which was much more &ldquo;whirling away.&rdquo;&nbsp; For
at Dorot the gypsies had been on exhibition; here at Petrovka they were
frolicking <i>en </i><!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span><i>famille</i> with a favored guest,&mdash;a
Romany rye from a far land to astonish and delight,&mdash;and he took good
care to let them feel that they were achieving a splendid success, for I
declared many times that it was <i>b&#363;tsi sh&#363;k&aacute;r</i>, or
very beautiful.&nbsp; Then I called for tea and lemon, and after that the
gypsies sang for their own amusement, Miss Sarsha, as the incarnation of
fun and jollity, taking the lead, and making me join in.&nbsp; Then the
crowd made way, and in the space appeared a very pretty little girl, in the
graceful old gypsy Oriental dress.&nbsp; This child danced charmingly
indeed, in a style strikingly like that of the Almeh of Egypt, but without
any of the erotic expressions which abound in Eastern pantomime.&nbsp; This
little Romany girl was to me enchanting, being altogether unaffected and
graceful.&nbsp; It was evident that her dancing, like the singing of her
elder sisters, was not an art which had been drilled in by
instruction.&nbsp; They had come into it in infancy, and perfected
themselves by such continual practice that what they did was as natural as
walking or talking.&nbsp; When the dancing was over, I begged that the
little girl would come to me, and, kissing her tiny gypsy hand, I said,
&ldquo;<i>Spassibo tute kamli</i>, <i>eto hi b&#363;tsi
sh&#363;k&aacute;r</i>&rdquo; (Thank you, dear; that is very pretty), with
which the rest were evidently pleased.&nbsp; I had observed among the
singers, at a little distance, a very remarkable and rather handsome old
woman,&mdash;a good study for an artist,&mdash;and she, as I also noticed,
had sung with a powerful and clear voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is our
grandmother,&rdquo; said one of the girls.&nbsp; Now, as every student of
gypsies knows, the first thing to do in England or Germany, on entering a
tent-gypsy encampment, is to be polite to &ldquo;the old
woman.&rdquo;&nbsp; Unless you can win <!-- page 57--><a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>her good opinion you
had better be gone.&nbsp; The Russian city Roms have apparently no such
fancies.&nbsp; On the road, however, life is patriarchal, and the
grandmother is a power to be feared.&nbsp; As a fortune-teller she is a
witch, ever at warfare with the police world; she has a bitter tongue, and
is quick to wrath.&nbsp; This was not the style or fashion of the old gypsy
singer; but, as soon as I saw the <i>puri babali dye</i>, I requested that
she would shake hand with me, and by the impression which this created I
saw that the Romany of the city had not lost all the feelings of the
road.</p>
<p>I spoke of Waramoff&rsquo;s beautiful song of the &ldquo;Krasneya
Sarafan,&rdquo; which Sarsha began at once to warble.&nbsp; The
characteristic of Russian gypsy-girl voices is a peculiarly delicate
metallic tone,&mdash;like that of the two silver bells of the Tower of Ivan
Velikoi when heard from afar,&mdash;yet always marked with fineness and
strength.&nbsp; This is sometimes startling in the wilder effects, but it
is always agreeable.&nbsp; These Moscow gypsy girls have a great name in
their art, and it was round the shoulders of one of them&mdash;for aught I
know it may have been Sarsha&rsquo;s great-grandmother&mdash;that Catalani
threw the cashmere shawl which had been given to her by the Pope as
&ldquo;to the best singer in the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not mine
by right,&rdquo; said the generous Italian; &ldquo;it belongs to the
gypsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gypsies were desirous of learning something about the songs of their
kindred in distant lands, and, though no singer, I did my best to please
them, the guitarist easily improvising accompaniments, while the girls
joined in.&nbsp; As all were in a gay mood faults were easily excused, and
the airs were much liked,&mdash;one lyric, set by Virginia Gabriel, being
even <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>more admired in Moscow than in St. Petersburg, apropos of which I
may mention that, when I afterward visited the gypsy family in their own
home, the first request from Sarsha was, &ldquo;<i>Eto gilyo</i>,
<i>rya</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>That</i> song, sir), referring to
&ldquo;Romany,&rdquo; which has been heard at several concerts in
London.&nbsp; And so, after much discussion of the affairs of Egypt, I took
my leave amid a chorus of kind farewells.&nbsp; Then Vassili, loudly called
for, reappeared from some nook with his elegantly frosted horse, and in a
few minutes we were dashing homeward.&nbsp; Cold!&nbsp; It was as severe as
in Western New York or Minnesota, where the thermometer for many days every
winter sinks lower than in St. Petersburg, but where there are no such
incredible precautions taken as in the land of double windows cemented
down, and fur-lined <i>shubas</i>.&nbsp; It is remarkable that the gypsies,
although of Oriental origin, are said to surpass the Russians in enduring
cold; and there is a marvelous story told about a Romany who, for a wager,
undertook to sleep naked against a clothed Muscovite on the ice of a river
during an unusually cold night.&nbsp; In the morning the Russian was found
frozen stiff, while the gypsy was snoring away unharmed.&nbsp; As we
returned, I saw in the town something which recalled this story in more
than one <i>moujik</i>, who, well wrapped up, lay sleeping in the open air,
under the lee of a house.&nbsp; Passing through silent Moscow on the early
Christmas morn, under the stars, as I gazed at the marvelous city, which
yields neither to Edinburgh, Cairo, nor Prague in picturesqueness, and
thought over the strange evening I had spent among the gypsies, I felt as
if I were in a melodrama with striking scenery.&nbsp; The pleasing
<i>finale</i> was the utter amazement and almost <!-- page 59--><a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>speechless gratitude of
Vassili at getting an extra half-ruble as an early Christmas gift.</p>
<p>As I had received a pressing invitation from the gypsies to come again,
I resolved to pay them a visit on Christmas afternoon in their own house,
if I could find it.&nbsp; Having ascertained that the gypsy street was in a
distant quarter, called the <i>Grouszini</i>, I engaged a sleigh, standing
before the door of the Slavanski-Bazaar Hotel, and the usual close bargain
with the driver was effected with the aid of a Russian gentleman, a
stranger passing by, who reduced the ruble (one hundred kopecks) at first
demanded to seventy kopecks.&nbsp; After a very long drive we found
ourselves in the gypsy street, and the <i>istvostshik</i> asked me,
&ldquo;To what house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gypsies live
here, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gypsies, and no others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I want to find a gypsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The driver laughed, and just at that instant I saw, as if awaiting me on
the sidewalk, Sarsha, Liubasha, and another young lady, with a good-looking
youth, their brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will do,&rdquo; I said to the driver, who appeared utterly
amazed at seeing me greeted like an old friend by the Zigani, but who
grinned with delight, as all Russians of the lower class invariably do at
anything like sociability and fraternity.&nbsp; The damsels were
faultlessly attired in Russian style, with full fur-lined, glossy
black-satin cloaks and fine Orenberg scarfs, which are, I believe, the
finest woolen fabrics in the world.&nbsp; The party were particularly
anxious to know if I had come specially to visit <i>them</i>, for I have
passed over the fact that I had also made the <!-- page 60--><a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>acquaintance of another
very large family of gypsies, who sang at a rival <i>caf&eacute;</i>, and
who had also treated me very kindly.&nbsp; I was at once conducted to a
house, which we entered in a rather gypsy way, not in front, but through a
court, a back door, and up a staircase, very much in the style of certain
dwellings in the Potteries in London.&nbsp; But, having entered, I was led
through one or two neat rooms, where I saw lying sound asleep on beds, but
dressed, one or two very dark Romanys, whose faces I remembered.&nbsp; Then
we passed into a sitting-room, which was very well furnished.&nbsp; I
observed hanging up over the chimney-piece a good collection of
photographs, nearly all of gypsies, and indicating that close resemblance
to Hindoos which comes out so strongly in such pictures, being, in fact,
more apparent in the pictures than in the faces; just as the photographs of
the old Ulfilas manuscript revealed alterations not visible in the
original.&nbsp; In the centre of the group was a cabinet-size portrait of
Sarsha, and by it another of an Englishman of <i>very</i> high rank.&nbsp;
I thought this odd, but asked no questions.</p>
<p>My hosts were very kind, offering me promptly a rich kind of Russian
cake, begging to know what else I would like to eat or drink, and
apparently deeply concerned that I could really partake of nothing, as I
had just come from luncheon.&nbsp; They were all light-hearted and gay, so
that the music began at once, as wild and as bewitching as ever.&nbsp; And
here I observed, even more than before, how thoroughly sincere these
gypsies were in their art, and to what a degree they enjoyed and were
excited by their own singing.&nbsp; Here in their own home, warbling like
birds and frolicking like children, their performance was even more
delightful <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>than it had been in the concert-room.&nbsp; There was evidently a
great source of excitement in the fact that I must enjoy it far more than
an ordinary stranger, because I understood Romany, and sympathized with
gypsy ways, and regarded them not as the <i>Gaji</i> or Gentiles do, but as
brothers and sisters.&nbsp; I confess that I was indeed moved by the simple
kindness with which I was treated, and I knew that, with the wonderfully
keen perception of character in which gypsies excel, they perfectly
understood my liking for them.&nbsp; It is this ready intuition of feelings
which, when it is raised from an instinct to an art by practice, enables
shrewd old women to tell fortunes with so much skill.</p>
<p>I was here introduced to the mother of the girls.&nbsp; She was a neat,
pleasant-looking woman, of perhaps forty years, in appearance and manners
irresistibly reminding me of some respectable Cuban lady.&nbsp; Like the
others, she displayed an intelligent curiosity as to my knowledge of
Romany, and I was pleased at finding that she knew much more of the
language than her children did.&nbsp; Then there entered a young Russian
gentleman, but not &ldquo;Prince Paul.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was, however, a very
agreeable person, as all Russians can be when so minded; and they are
always so minded when they gather, from information or conjecture, the fact
that the stranger whom they meet is one of education or position.&nbsp;
This young gentleman spoke French, and undertook the part of occasional
translator.</p>
<p>I asked Liubasha if any of them understood fortune-telling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; we have quite lost the art of <i>dorriki</i>. <a
name="citation61"></a><a href="#footnote61" class="citation">[61]</a>&nbsp;
None <!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>of us know anything about it.&nbsp; But we hear that you
Romanichals over the Black Water understand it.&nbsp; Oh,
<i>rya</i>,&rdquo; she cried, eagerly, &ldquo;you know so
much,&mdash;you&rsquo;re such a deep Romany,&mdash;can&rsquo;t <i>you</i>
tell fortunes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should indeed know very little about Romany ways,&rdquo; I
replied, gravely, &ldquo;if I could not <i>pen dorriki</i>.&nbsp; But I
tell you beforehand, <i>terni pen</i>, &lsquo;<i>dorrikipen hi
hokanipen</i>,&rsquo; little sister, fortune-telling is deceiving.&nbsp;
Yet what the lines say I can read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an instant six as pretty little gypsy hands as I ever beheld were
thrust before me, and I heard as many cries of delight.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell
<i>my</i> fortune, <i>rya</i>! tell mine! and <i>mine</i>!&rdquo; exclaimed
the damsels, and I complied.&nbsp; It was all very well to tell them there
was nothing in it; they knew a trick worth two of that.&nbsp; I perceived
at once that the faith which endures beyond its own knowledge was placed in
all I said.&nbsp; In England the gypsy woman, who at home ridicules her own
fortune-telling and her dupes, still puts faith in a <i>gusveri mush</i>,
or some &ldquo;wise man,&rdquo; who with crystal or magical apparatus
professes occult knowledge; for she thinks that her own false art is an
imitation of a true one.&nbsp; It is really amusing to see the reverence
with which an old gypsy will look at the awful hieroglyphics in Cornelius
Agrippa&rsquo;s &ldquo;Occult Philosophy,&rdquo; or, better still,
&ldquo;Trithemius,&rdquo; and, as a gift, any ordinary fortune-telling book
is esteemed by them beyond rubies.&nbsp; It is true that they cannot read
it, but the precious volume is treasured like a fetich, and the owner is
happy in the thought of at least possessing darksome and forbidden lore,
though it be of no earthly use to her.&nbsp; After all the kindness they
had shown me, I could not find <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>it in my heart to refuse to tell these gentle
Zingari their little fortunes.&nbsp; It is not, I admit, exactly in the
order of things that the chicken should dress the cook, or the Gorgio tell
fortunes to gypsies; but he who wanders in strange lands meets with strange
adventures.&nbsp; So, with a full knowledge of the legal penalties attached
in England to palmistry and other conjuration, and with the then pending
Slade case knocking heavily on my conscience, I proceeded to examine and
predict.&nbsp; When I afterward narrated this incident to the late G. H.
Lewes, he expressed himself to the effect that to tell fortunes to gypsies
struck him as the very <i>ne plus ultra</i> of cheek,&mdash;which shows how
extremes meet; for verily it was with great modesty and proper diffidence
that I ventured to foretell the lives of these little ladies, having an
antipathy to the practice of chiromancing as to other romancing.</p>
<p>I have observed that as among men of great and varied culture, and of
extensive experience, there are more complex and delicate shades and
half-shades of light in the face, so in the palm the lines are
correspondingly varied and broken.&nbsp; Take a man of intellect and a
peasant, of equal excellence of figure according to the literal rules of
art or of anatomy, and this subtile multiplicity of variety shows itself in
the whole body in favor of the &ldquo;gentleman,&rdquo; so that it would
almost seem as if every book we read is republished in the person.&nbsp;
The first thing that struck me in these gypsy hands was the fewness of the
lines, their clearly defined sweep, and their simplicity.&nbsp; In every
one the line of life was unbroken, and, in fine, one might think from a
drawing of the hand, and without knowing who its owner might be, that he or
<!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>she
was of a type of character unknown in most great European cities,&mdash;a
being gifted with special culture, and in a certain simple sense refined,
but not endowed with experience in a thousand confused phases of
life.&nbsp; The hands of a true genius, who has passed through life
earnestly devoted to a single art, however, are on the whole like these of
the gypsies.&nbsp; Such, for example, are the hands of Fanny Janauschek,
the lines of which agree to perfection with the laws of chiromancy.&nbsp;
The art reminds one of Cervantes&rsquo;s ape, who told the past and
present, but not the future.&nbsp; And here &ldquo;tell me what thou hast
been, and I will tell what thou wilt be&rdquo; gives a fine opportunity to
the soothsayer.</p>
<p>To avoid mistakes I told the fortunes in French, which was translated
into Russian.&nbsp; I need not say that every word was listened to with
earnest attention, or that the group of dark but young and comely faces, as
they gathered around and bent over, would have made a good subject for a
picture.&nbsp; After the girls, the mother must needs hear her
<i>dorriki</i> also, and last of all the young Russian gentleman, who
seemed to take as earnest an interest in his future as even the
gypsies.&nbsp; As he alone understood French, and as he appeared to be
<i>un peu gaillard</i>, and, finally, as the lines of his hand said nothing
to the contrary, I predicted for him in detail a fortune in which <i>bonnes
fortunes</i> were not at all wanting.&nbsp; I think he was pleased, but
when I asked him if he would translate what I had said of his future into
Russian, he replied with a slight wink and a scarcely perceptible
negative.&nbsp; I suppose he had his reasons for declining.</p>
<p>Then we had singing again, and Christopher, the brother, a wild and gay
young gypsy, became so excited <!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>that while playing the guitar he also danced
and caroled, and the sweet voices of the girls rose in chorus, and I was
again importuned for the <i>Romany</i> song, and we had altogether a very
Bohemian frolic.&nbsp; I was sorry when the early twilight faded into
night, and I was obliged, notwithstanding many entreaties to the contrary,
to take my leave.&nbsp; These gypsies had been very friendly and kind to me
in a strange city, where I had not an acquaintance, and where I had
expected none.&nbsp; They had given me of their very best; for they gave me
songs which I can never forget, and which were better to me than all the
opera could bestow.&nbsp; The young Russian, polite to the last, went
bareheaded with me into the street, and, hailing a sleigh-driver, began to
bargain for me.&nbsp; In Moscow, as in other places, it makes a great
difference in the fare whether one takes a public conveyance from before
the first hotel or from a house in the gypsy quarter.&nbsp; I had paid
seventy kopecks to come, and I at once found that my new friend and the
driver were engaged in wild and fierce dispute whether I should pay twenty
or thirty to return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, give him thirty!&rdquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
little enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Non</i>,&rdquo; replied the Russian, with the air of a man of
principles.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Il ne faut pas g&acirc;ter ces
gens-la</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; But I gave the driver thirty, all the same, when
we got home, and thereby earned the usual shower of blessings.</p>
<p>A few days afterward, while going from Moscow to St. Petersburg, I made
the acquaintance of a young Russian noble and diplomat, who was well
informed on all current gossip, and learned from him some curious
facts.&nbsp; The first young gentleman whom I <!-- page 66--><a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>had seen among the
Romanys of Moscow was the son of a Russian prince by a gypsy mother, and
the very noble Englishman whose photograph I had seen in Sarsha&rsquo;s
collection had not long ago (as rumor averred) paid desperate attentions to
the belle of the Romanys without obtaining the least success.&nbsp; My
informant did not know her name.&nbsp; Putting this and that together, I
think it highly probable that Sarsha was the young lady, and that the
<i>latcho bar</i>, or diamond, which sparkled on her finger had been paid
for with British gold, while the donor had gained the same
&ldquo;unluck&rdquo; which befell one of his type in the Spanish gypsy song
as given by George Borrow:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Loud sang the Spanish cavalier,<br />
&nbsp;  And thus his ditty ran:<br />
&lsquo;God send the gypsy maiden here,<br />
&nbsp;  But not the gypsy man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On high arose the moon so bright,<br />
&nbsp;  The gypsy &rsquo;gan to sing,<br />
&lsquo;I gee a Spaniard coming here,<br />
&nbsp;  I must be on the wing.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

67</span>AUSTRIAN GYPSIES.</h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p>In June, 1878, I went to Paris, during the great Exhibition.&nbsp; I had
been invited by Monsieur Edmond About to attend as a delegate the
Congr&egrave;s Internationale Litt&eacute;raire, which was about to be held
in the great city.&nbsp; How we assembled, how M. About distinguished
himself as one of the most practical and common-sensible of men of genius,
and how we were all finally harangued by M. Victor Hugo with the most
extraordinary display of oratorical sky-rockets, Catherine-wheels,
blue-lights, fire-crackers, and pin-wheels by which it was ever my luck to
be amused, is matter of history.&nbsp; But this chapter is only
autobiographical, and we will pass over the history.&nbsp; As an
Anglo-American delegate, I was introduced to several great men gratis; to
the greatest of all I introduced myself at the expense of half a
franc.&nbsp; This was to the Chinese giant, Chang, who was on exhibition at
a small caf&eacute; garden near the Trocadero.&nbsp; There were no other
visitors in his pavilion when I entered.&nbsp; He received me with
politeness, and we began to converse in fourth-story English, but gradually
went down-stairs into Pidgin, until we found ourselves fairly in the
kitchen of that humble but entertaining dialect.&nbsp; It is a remarkable
sensation to sit alone with <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>a mild monster, and feel like a little
boy.&nbsp; I do not distinctly remember whether Chang is eight, or ten or
twelve feet high; I only know that, though I am, as he said, &ldquo;one
velly big piecee man,&rdquo; I sat and lifted my eyes from time to time at
the usual level, forgetfully expecting to meet his eyes, and beheld instead
the buttons on his breast.&nbsp; Then I looked up&mdash;like Daruma to
Buddha&mdash;and up, and saw far above me his &ldquo;lights of the
soul&rdquo; gleaming down on me as it were from the top of a lofty
beacon.</p>
<p>I soon found that Chang, regarding all things from a giant&rsquo;s point
of view, esteemed mankind by their size and looks.&nbsp; Therefore, as he
had complimented me according to his lights, I replied that he was a
&ldquo;numpa one too muchee glanti handsome man, first chop big.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he added, &ldquo;You belongy Inklis man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; My one piecee <i>fa-ke-kwok</i>;  my
Melican, galaw.&nbsp; You dlinkee ale some-tim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The giant replied that <i>pay-wine</i>, which is Pidgin for beer, was
not ungrateful to his palate or foreign to his habits.&nbsp; So we had a
quart of Alsopp between us, and drank to better acquaintance.&nbsp; I found
that the giant had exhibited himself in many lands, and taken great pains
to learn the language of each, so that he spoke German, Italian, and
Spanish well enough.&nbsp; He had been at a mission-school when he used to
&ldquo;stop China-side,&rdquo; or was in his native land.&nbsp; I assured
him that I had perceived it from the first, because he evidently
&ldquo;talked ink,&rdquo; as his countrymen say of words which are uttered
by a scholar, and I greatly gratified him by citing some of my own
&ldquo;beautiful verses,&rdquo; which are reversed from a Chinese
original:&mdash;</p>

<p>So we parted with mutual esteem.&nbsp; This was the second man by the
name of Chang whom I had known, and singularly enough they were both
exhibited as curiosities.&nbsp; The other made a living as a Siamese twin,
and his brother was named Eng.&nbsp; They wrote their autographs for me,
and put them wisely at the very top of the page, lest I should write a
promise to pay an immense sum of money, or forge a free pass to come into
the exhibition gratis over their signatures.</p>
<p>Having seen Chang, I returned to the H&ocirc;tel de Louvre, dined, and
then went forth with friends to the Orangerie.&nbsp; This immense garden,
devoted to concerts, beer, and cigars, is said to be capable of containing
three thousand people; before I left it it held about five thousand.&nbsp;
I knew not why this unwonted crowd had assembled; when I found the cause I
was astonished, with reason.&nbsp; At the gate was a bill, on which I read
&ldquo;Les Bohemiennes de Moscow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some small musical comedy, I suppose,&rdquo; I said to
myself.&nbsp; &ldquo;But let us see it.&rdquo;&nbsp; We pressed on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look there!&rdquo; said my companion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Those are
certainly gypsies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough, a procession of men and women, strangely dressed in gayly
colored Oriental garments, was entering the gates.&nbsp; But I replied,
&ldquo;Impossible.&nbsp; Not here in Paris.&nbsp; Probably they are
performers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But see.&nbsp; They notice you.&nbsp; That girl certainly <!--
page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>knows
you.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s turning her head.&nbsp; There,&mdash;I heard her say
O Romany rye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was bewildered.&nbsp; The crowd was dense, but as the procession
passed me at a second turn I saw they were indeed gypsies, and I was
grasped by the hand by more than one.&nbsp; They were my old friends from
Moscow.&nbsp; This explained the immense multitude.&nbsp; There was during
the Exhibition a great <i>furor</i> as regarded <i>les zigains</i>.&nbsp;
The gypsy orchestra which performed in the Hungarian caf&eacute; was so
beset by visitors that a comic paper represented them as covering the roofs
of the adjacent houses so as to hear something.&nbsp; This evening the
Russian gypsies were to make their d&eacute;but in the Orangerie, and they
were frightened at their own success.&nbsp; They sang, but their voices
were inaudible to two thirds of the audience, and those who could not hear
roared, &ldquo;Louder!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then they adjourned to the open air,
where the voices were lost altogether on a crowd calling,
&ldquo;<i>Gar&ccedil;on</i>&mdash;<i>vite</i>&mdash;<i>une tasse
caf&eacute;</i>!&rdquo; or applauding.&nbsp; In the intervals scores of
young Russian gentlemen, golden swells, who had known the girls of old,
gathered round the fair ones like moths around tapers.&nbsp; The singing
was not the same as it had been; the voices were the same, but the sweet
wild charm of the Romany caroling, bird-like, for pleasure was gone.</p>
<p>But I found by themselves and unnoticed two of the troupe, whom I shall
not soon forget.&nbsp; They were two very handsome youths,&mdash;one of
sixteen years, the other twenty.&nbsp; And with the first words in Romany
they fairly jumped for joy; and the artist who could have caught their
picture then would have made a brave one.&nbsp; They were clad in blouses
of colored silk, which, with their fine dark complexions <!-- page 71--><a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>and great black eyes,
gave them a very picturesque air.&nbsp; These had not seen me in Russia,
nor had they heard of me; they were probably from Novogorod.&nbsp; Like the
girls they were children, but in a greater degree, for they had not been
flattered, and kind words delighted them so that they clapped their
hands.&nbsp; They began to hum gypsy songs, and had I not prevented it they
would have run at once and brought a guitar, and improvised a small concert
for me <i>al fresco</i>.&nbsp; I objected to this, not wishing to take part
any longer in such a very public exhibition.&nbsp; For the
<i>gobe-mouches</i> and starers, noticing a stranger talking with <i>ces
zigains</i>, had begun to gather in a dense crowd around us, and the two
ladies and the gentleman who were with us were seriously
inconvenienced.&nbsp; We endeavored to step aside, but the multitude
stepped aside also, and would not let us alone.&nbsp; They were French, but
they might have been polite.&nbsp; As it was, they broke our merry
conference up effectively, and put us to flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do let us come and see you, <i>rya</i>,&rdquo; said the younger
boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;We will sing, for I can really sing beautifully, and we
like you so much.&nbsp; Where do you live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could not invite them, for I was about to leave Paris, as I then
supposed.&nbsp; I have never seen them since, and there was no adventure
and no strange scenery beyond the thousands of lights and guests and trees
and voices speaking French.&nbsp; Yet to this day the gay boyishness, the
merry laughter, and the child-like <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> of the
promptly-formed liking of those gypsy youths remains impressed on my mind
with all the color and warmth of an adventure or a living poem.&nbsp; Can
you recall no child by any wayside <!-- page 72--><a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>of life to whom you
have given a chance smile or a kind word, and been repaid with artless
sudden attraction?&nbsp; For to all of us,&mdash;yes, to the coldest and
worst,&mdash;there are such memories of young people, of children, and I
pity him who, remembering them, does not feel the touch of a vanished hand
and hear a chord which is still.&nbsp; There are adventures which we can
tell to others as stories, but the best have no story; they may be only the
memory of a strange dog which followed us, and I have one such of a cat
who, without any introduction, leaped wildly towards me, &ldquo;and would
not thence away.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a good life which has many such
memories.</p>
<p>I was walking a day or two after with an English friend, who was also a
delegate to the International Literary Congress, in the Exhibition, when we
approached the side gate, or rear entrance of the Hungarian
caf&eacute;.&nbsp; Six or seven dark and strange-looking men stood about,
dressed in the uniform of a military band.&nbsp; I caught their glances,
and saw that they were Romany.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you shall see something queer,&rdquo; I said to my
friend.</p>
<p>So advancing to the first dark man I greeted him in gypsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not understand you,&rdquo; he promptly replied&mdash;or
lied.</p>
<p>I turned to a second.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have more sense, and you do understand.&nbsp; <i>Adro miro
tem penena mande o baro rai</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; (In my country the gypsies
call me the great gentleman.)</p>
<p>This phrase may be translated to mean either the &ldquo;tall
gentleman&rdquo; or the &ldquo;great lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was apparently
taken in the latter sense, for at once all the <!-- page 73--><a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>party bowed very low,
raising their hands to their foreheads, in Oriental fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; exclaimed my English friend, who had not understood
what I had said.&nbsp; &ldquo;What game is this you are playing on these
fellows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up to the front came a superior, the leader of the band.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great God!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;what is this I hear?&nbsp;
This is wonderful.&nbsp; To think that there should be anybody here to talk
with!&nbsp; I can only talk Magyar and Romanes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you talk?&rdquo; I inquired of the first violin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ich spreche nur Deutsch</i>!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with a
strong Vienna accent and a roar of laughter.&nbsp; &ldquo;I only talk
German.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This worthy man, I found, was as much delighted with my German as the
leader with my gypsy; and in all my experience I never met two beings so
charmed at being able to converse.&nbsp; That I should have met with them
was of itself wonderful.&nbsp; Only there was this difference: that the
Viennese burst into a laugh every time he spoke, while the gypsy grew more
sternly solemn and awfully impressive.&nbsp; There are people to whom mere
talking is a pleasure,&mdash;never mind the ideas,&mdash;and here I had
struck two at once.&nbsp; I once knew a gentleman named Stewart.&nbsp; He
was the mayor, first physician, and postmaster of St. Paul,
Minnesota.&nbsp; While camping out, <i>en route</i>, and in a tent with
him, it chanced that among the other gentlemen who had tented with us there
were two terrible snorers.&nbsp; Now Mr. Stewart had heard that you may
stop a man&rsquo;s snoring by whistling.&nbsp; And here was a wonderful
opportunity.&nbsp; <!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>&ldquo;So I waited,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;until one man was coming down with his snore, <i>diminuendo</i>,
while the other was rising, <i>crescendo</i>, and at the exact point of
intersection, <i>moderato</i>, I blew my car-whistle, and so got both birds
at one shot.&nbsp; I stopped them both.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even as Mayor Stewart
had winged his two birds with one ball had I hit my two peregrines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are now going to perform,&rdquo; said the gypsy captain.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Will you not take seats on the platform, and hear us
play?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not know it at the time, but I heard afterwards that this was a
great compliment, and one rarely bestowed.&nbsp; The platform was small,
and we were very near our new friends.&nbsp; Scarcely had the performance
begun ere I perceived that, just as the gypsies in Russia had sung their
best in my honor, these artists were exerting themselves to the utmost,
and, all unheeding the audience, playing directly at me and into me.&nbsp;
When any <i>tour</i> was deftly made the dark master nodded to me with
gleaming eyes, as if saying, &ldquo;What do you think of <i>that</i>,
now?&rdquo;&nbsp; The Viennese laughed for joy every time his glance met
mine, and as I looked at the various Lajoshes and Joshkas of the band, they
blew, beat, or scraped with redoubled fury, or sank into thrilling
tenderness.&nbsp; Hurrah! here was somebody to play to who knew gypsy and
all the games thereof; for a very little, even a word, reveals a great
deal, and I must be a virtuoso, at least by Romany, if not by art.&nbsp; It
was with all the joy of success that the first piece ended amid thunders of
applause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was not the <i>racoczy</i>,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yet
it sounded like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;But <i>now</i> you
shall hear <!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>the <i>racoczy</i> and the <i>czardas</i> as you never heard them
before.&nbsp; For we can play that better than any orchestra in
Vienna.&nbsp; Truly, you will never forget us after hearing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then they played the <i>racoczy</i>, the national Hungarian
favorite, of gypsy composition, with heart and soul.&nbsp; As these men
played for me, inspired with their own music, feeling and enjoying it far
more than the audience, and all because they had got a gypsy gentleman to
play to, I appreciated what a <i>life</i> that was to them, and what it
should be; not cold-blooded skill, aiming only at excellence or
pre&euml;xcellence and at setting up the artist, but a fire and a joy, a
self-forgetfulness which whirls the soul away as the soul of the
M&oelig;nad went with the stream adown the mountains,&mdash;<i>Evo&euml;
Bacchus</i>!&nbsp; This feeling is deep in the heart of the Hungarian
gypsy; he plays it, he feels it in every air, he knows the rush of the
stream as it bounds onwards,&mdash;knows that it expresses his deepest
desire; and so he has given it words in a song which, to him who has the
key, is one of the most touching ever written:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dyal o pa&ntilde;i repedishis,<br />
M&rsquo;ro pirano hegedishis;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dyal o pa&ntilde;i tale vatra,<br />
M&rsquo;ro pirano klanetaha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dyal o pa&ntilde;i pe kishai<br />
M&rsquo;ro pirano tsino rai.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stream runs on with rushing din<br />
As I hear my true love&rsquo;s violin;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the river rolls o&rsquo;er rock and stone<br />
As he plays the flute so sweet alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Runs o&rsquo;er the sand as it began,<br />
Then my true love lives a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>Yes, music whirling the soul away as on a rushing river, the
violin notes falling like ripples, the flute tones all aflow among the
rocks; and when it sweeps <i>adagio</i> on the sandy bed, then the gypsy
player is at heart equal to a lord, then he feels a gentleman.&nbsp; The
only true republic is art.&nbsp; There all earthly distinctions pass away;
there he is best who lives and feels best, and makes others feel, not that
he is cleverer than they, but that he can awaken sympathy and joy.</p>
<p>The intense reality of musical art as a comforter to these gypsies of
Eastern Europe is wonderful.&nbsp; Among certain inedited songs of the
Transylvanian gypsies, in the Kolosv&aacute;rer dialect, I find the
following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Na janav ko dad m&rsquo;ro as,<br />
Niko m&#257;llen mange as,<br />
Miro gule dai merdyas<br />
Pirani me pregelyas.<br />
Uva tu o hegedive<br />
Tu sal mind&#299;k pash mange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known no father since my birth,<br />
I have no friend alive on earth;<br />
My mother&rsquo;s dead this many day,<br />
The girl I loved has gone her way;<br />
Thou violin with music free<br />
Alone art ever true to me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is very wonderful that the charm of the Russian gypsy girls&rsquo;
singing was destroyed by the atmosphere or applause of a Paris
concert-room, while the Hungarian Romanys conquered it as it were by sheer
force, and by conquering gave their music the charm of intensity.&nbsp; I
do not deny that in this music, be it of voice or instruments, there is
much which is perhaps imagined, which depends on association, which is
plain to John but not to Jack; but you have only <!-- page 77--><a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>to advance or retreat a
few steps to find the same in the highest art.&nbsp; This, at least, we
know: that no performer at any concert in London can awake the feeling of
intense enjoyment which these wild minstrels excite in themselves and in
others by sympathy.&nbsp; Now it is a question in many forms as to whether
art for enjoyment is to die, and art for the sake of art alone
survive.&nbsp; Is joyous and healthy nature to vanish step by step from the
heart of man, and morbid, egoistic pessimism to take its place?&nbsp; Are
over-culture, excessive sentiment, constant self-criticism, and all the
brood of nervous curses to monopolize and inspire art?&nbsp; A fine
alliance this they are making, the ascetic monk and the atheistic
pessimist, to kill Nature!&nbsp; They will never effect it.&nbsp; It may
die in many forms.&nbsp; It may lose its charm, as the singing of Sarsha
and of Liubasha was lost among the rustling and noise of thousands of
Parisian <i>badauds</i> in the Orangerie.&nbsp; But there will be stronger
forms of art, which will make themselves heard, as the Hungarian Romanys
heeded no din, and bore all away with their music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Latcho d&iacute;vvus miri pralia</i>!&mdash;<i>miduvel atch pa
tumende</i>!&rdquo; (Good-day, my brothers.&nbsp; God rest on you) I said,
and they rose and bowed, and I went forth into the Exhibition.&nbsp; It was
a brave show, that of all the fine things from all parts of the world which
man can make, but to me the most interesting of all were the men
themselves.&nbsp; Will not the managers of the next world show give us a
living ethnological department?</p>
<p>Of these Hungarian gypsies who played in Paris during the Exhibition
much was said in the newspapers, and from the following, which appeared in
an <!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>American journal, written by some one to me unknown, the reader
may learn that there were many others to whom their music was deeply
thrilling or wildly exciting:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Hungarian Tziganes (Zigeuner) are the rage just now at
Paris.&nbsp; The story is that Liszt picked out the individuals composing
the band one by one from among the gypsy performers in Hungary and
Bohemia.&nbsp; Half-civilized in appearance, dressed in an unbecoming
half-military costume, they are nothing while playing Strauss&rsquo;
waltzes or their own; but when they play the Radetsky Defile, the Racoksky
March, or their marvelous czardas, one sees and hears the battle, and it is
easy to understand the influence of their music in fomenting Hungarian
revolutions; why for so long it was made treasonable to play or listen to
these czardas; and why, as they heard them, men rose to their feet,
gathered together, and with tears rolling down their faces, and throats
swelling with emotion, departed to do or die.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And when I remember that they played for me as they said they had played
for no other man in Paris, &ldquo;into the ear,&rdquo;&mdash;and when I
think of the gleam in their eyes, I verily believe they <i>told</i> the
truth,&mdash;I feel glad that I chanced that morning on those dark men and
spoke to them in Romany.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Since the above was written I have met in an entertaining work called
&ldquo;Unknown Hungary,&rdquo; by Victor Tissot, with certain remarks on
the Hungarian gypsy musicians which are so appropriate that I cite them in
full:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The gypsy artists in Hungary play by inspiration, with inimitable
<i>verve</i> and spirit, without even <!-- page 79--><a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>knowing their notes,
and nothing whatever of the rhymes and rules of the masters.&nbsp; Liszt,
who has closely studied them, says, The art of music being for them a
sublime language, a song, mystic in itself, though dear to the initiated,
they use it according to the wants of the moment which they wish to
express.&nbsp; They have invented their music for their own use, to sing
about themselves to themselves, to express themselves in the most heartfelt
and touching monologues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their music is as free as their lives; no intermediate
modulation, no chords, no transition, it goes from one key to
another.&nbsp; From ethereal heights they precipitate you into the howling
depths of hell; from the plaint, barely heard, they pass brusquely to the
warrior&rsquo;s song, which bursts loudly forth, passionate and tender, at
once burning and calm.&nbsp; Their melodies plunge you into a melancholy
reverie, or carry you away into a stormy whirlwind; they are a faithful
expression of the Hungarian character, sometimes quick, brilliant, and
lively, sometimes sad and apathetic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gypsies, when they arrived in Hungary, had no music of their
own; they appropriated the Magyar music, and made from it an original art
which now belongs to them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I here break in upon Messieurs Tissot and Liszt to remark that, while it
is very probable that the Roms reformed Hungarian music, it is rather
boldly assumed that they had no music of their own.&nbsp; It was, among
other callings, as dancers and musicians that they left India and entered
Europe, and among them were doubtless many descendants of the ten thousand
Indo-Persian Luris or Nuris.&nbsp; But to resume quotation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;They made from it an art full of life, passion, <!-- page 80--><a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>laughter, and
tears.&nbsp; The instrument which the gypsies prefer is the violin, which
they call <i>bas&rsquo; alja</i>, &lsquo;the king of
instruments.&rsquo;&nbsp; They also play the viola, the cymbal, and the
clarionet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a pause.&nbsp; The gypsies, who had perceived at a
table a comfortable-looking man, evidently wealthy, and on a pleasure
excursion in the town, came down from their platform, and ranged themselves
round him to give him a serenade all to himself, as is their custom.&nbsp;
They call this &lsquo;playing into the ear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They first asked the gentleman his favorite air, and then played
it with such spirit and enthusiasm and overflowing richness of variation
and ornament, and with so much emotion, that it drew forth the applause of
the whole company.&nbsp; After this they executed a czardas, one of the
wildest, most feverish, harshest, and, one may say, tormenting, as if to
pour intoxication into the soul of their listener.&nbsp; They watched his
countenance to note the impression produced by the passionate rhythm of
their instruments; then, breaking off suddenly, they played a hushed, soft,
caressing measure; and again, almost breaking the trembling cords of their
bows, they produced such an intensity of effect that the listener was
almost beside himself with delight and astonishment.&nbsp; He sat as if
bewitched; he shut his eyes, hung his head in melancholy, or raised it with
a start, as the music varied; then jumped up and struck the back of his
head with his hands.&nbsp; He positively laughed and cried at once; then,
drawing a roll of bank-notes from his pocket-book, he threw it to the
gypsies, and fell back in his chair, as if exhausted with so much
enjoyment.&nbsp; And in <i>this</i> lies the triumph of the <!-- page
81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>gypsy music; it
is like that of Orpheus, which moved the rocks and trees.&nbsp; The soul of
the Hungarian plunges, with a refinement of sensation that we can
understand, but cannot follow, into this music, which, like the
unrestrained indulgence of the imagination in fantasy and caprice, gives to
the initiated all the intoxicating sensations experienced by opium
smokers.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Austrian gypsies have many songs which perfectly reflect their
character.&nbsp; Most of them are only single verses of a few lines, such
as are sung everywhere in Spain; others, which are longer, seem to have
grown from the connection of these verses.&nbsp; The following translation
from the Roumanian Romany (Vassile Alexandri) gives an idea of their style
and spirit:&mdash;</p>
<h4>GYPSY SONG.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The wind whistles over the heath,<br />
The moonlight flits over the flood;<br />
And the gypsy lights up his fire,<br />

</blockquote>
<p>There is a deep, strange element in the gypsy character, which finds no
sympathy or knowledge in the German, and very little in other Europeans,
but which is so much in accord with the Slavonian and Hungarian that he who
truly feels it with love is often disposed to mingle them together.&nbsp;
It is a dreamy mysticism; an indefinite semi-supernaturalism, often passing
into gloom; a feeling as of Buddhism which has glided into Northern snows,
and taken a new and darker life in winter-lands.&nbsp; It is strong in the
Czech or Bohemian, whose nature is the worst understood in the civilized
world.&nbsp; That he should hate the German <!-- page 83--><a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>with all his heart and
soul is in the order of things.&nbsp; We talk about the mystical Germans,
but German self-conscious mysticism is like a problem of Euclid beside the
natural, unexpressed dreaminess of the Czech.&nbsp; The German mystic goes
to work at once to expound his &ldquo;system&rdquo; in categories, dressing
it up in a technology which in the end proves to be the only mystery in
it.&nbsp; The Bohemian and gypsy, each in their degrees of culture, form no
system and make no technology, but they feel all the more.&nbsp; Now the
difference between true and imitative mysticism is that the former takes no
form; it is even narrowed by religious creeds, and wing-clipt by pious
&ldquo;illumination.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nature, and nature alone, is its real
life.&nbsp; It was from the Southern Slavonian lands that all real
mysticism, and all that higher illumination which means freedom, came into
Germany and Europe; and after all, Germany&rsquo;s first and best mystic,
Jacob B&ouml;hme, was Bohemian by name, as he was by nature.&nbsp; When the
world shall have discovered who the as yet unknown Slavonian German was who
wrote all the best part of &ldquo;Consuelo,&rdquo; and who helped himself
in so doing from &ldquo;Der letzte Taborit,&rdquo; by Herlossohn, we shall
find one of the few men who understood the Bohemian.</p>
<p>Once in a while, as in Fanny Janauschek, the Czech bursts out into art,
and achieves a great triumph.&nbsp; I have seen Rachel and Ristori many a
time, but their best acting was shallow compared to Janauschek&rsquo;s, as
I have seen it in by-gone years, when she played Iphigenia and Medea in
German.&nbsp; No one save a Bohemian could ever so <i>intuit</i> the gloomy
profundity and unearthly fire of the Colchian sorceress.&nbsp; These are
the things required to perfect every <!-- page 84--><a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>artist,&mdash;above
all, the tragic artist,&mdash;that the tree of his or her genius shall not
only soar to heaven among the angels, but also have roots in the depths of
darkness and fire; and that he or she shall play not only to the audience,
and in sympathy with them, but also unto one&rsquo;s self and down to
one&rsquo;s deepest dreams.</p>
<p>No one will accuse me of wide discussion or padding who understands my
drift in this chapter.&nbsp; I am speaking of the gypsy, and I cannot
explain him more clearly than by showing his affinities with the Slavonian
and Magyar, and how, through music and probably in many other ways, he has
influenced them.&nbsp; As the Spaniard perfectly understands the objective
vagabond side of the Gitano, so the Southeastern European understands the
musical and wild-forest yearnings of the Tsigane.&nbsp; Both to gypsy and
Slavonian there is that which makes them dream so that even debauchery has
for them at times an unearthly inspiration; and as smoking was
inexpressibly sacred to the red Indians of old, so that when the Guatemalan
Christ harried hell, the demons offered him cigars; in like manner
tipsiness is often to the gypsy and Servian, or Czech, or Croat, something
so serious and impressive that it is a thing not to be lightly thought of,
but to be undertaken with intense deliberation and under due appreciation
of its benefits.</p>
<p>Many years ago, when I had begun to feel this strange element I gave it
expression in a poem which I called &ldquo;The Bohemian,&rdquo; as
expressive of both gypsy and Slavonian nature:&mdash;</p>

is the re&euml;cho of more than one song of those strange lands, of more
than one voice, and of many a melody; and those who have heard them, though
not more distinctly than Fran&ccedil;ois Villon when he spoke of flinging
the question back by silent lake and streamlet lone, will understand me,
and say it is true to nature.</p>
<p>In a late work on Magyarland, by a lady Fellow of the Carpathian
Society, I find more on Hungarian gypsy music, which is so well written
that I quote fully from it, being of the opinion that one ought, when
setting forth any subject, to give quite as good an opportunity to others
who are in our business as to ourselves.&nbsp; And truly this lady has felt
the charm of the Tsigan music and describes it so well that one wishes she
were a Romany in language and by adoption, like unto a dozen dames and
damsels whom I know.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Magyars have a perfect passion for this gypsy music, and
there is nothing that appeals so powerfully to their emotions, whether of
joy or sorrow.&nbsp; These singular musicians are, as a rule, well taught,
and can play almost any music, greatly preferring, however, their own
compositions.&nbsp; Their music, consequently, is highly
characteristic.&nbsp; It is the language of their lives and strange
surroundings, a wild, weird banshee music: now all joy and sparkle, like
sunshine on the plains; now sullen, sad, and pathetic by turns, like the
wail of a crushed and oppressed people,&mdash;an echo, it is said, of the
minstrelsy of the <i>heged&ouml;s&ouml;k</i> or Hungarian bards, but
sounding to our ears like the more distant echo of that exceeding bitter
cry, uttered long centuries ago by their forefathers under Egyptian
bondage, and borne over the time-waves of thousands of years, breaking
forth in their music of to-day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>Here I interrupt the lady&mdash;with all due courtesy&mdash;to
remark that I cannot agree with her, nor with her probable authority,
Walter Simson, in believing that the gypsies are the descendants of the
mixed races who followed Moses out of Egypt.&nbsp; The Rom in Egypt is a
Hindoo stranger now, as he ever was.&nbsp; But that the echo of centuries
of outlawry and wretchedness and wildness rises and falls, like the
ineffable discord in a wind-harp, in Romany airs is true enough, whatever
its origin may have been.&nbsp; But I beg pardon, madam,&mdash;I
interrupted you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The soul-stirring, madly exciting, and martial strains of the
Racoczys&mdash;one of the Revolutionary airs&mdash;has just died upon the
ear.&nbsp; A brief interval of rest has passed.&nbsp; Now listen with bated
breath to that recitative in the minor key,&mdash;that passionate wail,
that touching story, the gypsies&rsquo; own music, which rises and falls on
the air.&nbsp; Knives and forks are set down, hands and arms hang listless,
all the seeming necessities of the moment being either suspended or
forgotten,&mdash;merged in the memories which those vibrations, so akin to
human language, reawaken in each heart.&nbsp; Eyes involuntarily fill with
tears, as those pathetic strains echo back and make present some sorrow of
long ago, or rouse from slumber that of recent time. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, the recitative being ended, and the last chord struck,
the melody begins, of which the former was the prelude.&nbsp; Watch the
movements of the supple figure of the first violin, standing in the centre
of the other musicians, who accompany him softly.&nbsp; How every nerve is
<i>en rapport</i> with his instrument, and how his very soul is speaking
through it!&nbsp; See how gently he draws the bow across the trembling
strings, <!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>and how lovingly he lays his cheek upon it, as if listening to
some responsive echo of his heart&rsquo;s inmost feeling, for it is his
mystic language!&nbsp; How the instrument lives and answers to his every
touch, sending forth in turn utterances tender, sad, wild, and
joyous!&nbsp; The audience once more hold their breath to catch the dying
tones, as the melody, so rich, so beautiful, so full of pathos, is drawing
to a close.&nbsp; The tension is absolutely painful as the gypsy dwells on
the last lingering note, and it is a relief when, with a loud and general
burst of sound, every performer starts into life and motion.&nbsp;
<i>Then</i> what crude and wild dissonances are made to resolve themselves
into delicious harmony!&nbsp; What rapturous and fervid phrases, and what
energy and impetuosity, are there in every motion of the gypsies&rsquo;
figures, as their dark eyes glisten and emit flashes in unison with the
tones!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The writer is gifted in giving words to gypsy music.&nbsp; One cannot
say, as the inexhaustible Cad writes of Niagara ten times on a page in the
Visitors&rsquo; Book, that it is indescribable.&nbsp; I think that if
language means anything this music has been very well described by the
writers whom I have cited.&nbsp; When I am told that the gypsies&rsquo;
impetuous and passionate natures make them enter into musical action with
heart and soul, I feel not only the strains played long ago, but also hear
therein the horns of Elfland blowing,&mdash;which he who has not heard, of
summer days, in the drone of the bee, by reedy rustling stream, will never
know on earth in any wise.&nbsp; But once heard it comes ever, as I, though
in the city, heard it last night in the winter wind, with Romany words
mingled in wild refrain:&mdash;</p>

91</span>II.&nbsp; AUSTRIAN GYPSIES IN PHILADELPHIA.</h3>
<p>It was a sunny Sunday afternoon, and I was walking down Chestnut Street,
Philadelphia, when I met with three very dark men.</p>
<p>Dark men are not rarities in my native city.&nbsp; There is, for
instance, Eugene, who has the invaluable faculty of being able to turn his
hand to an infinite helpfulness in the small arts.&nbsp; These men were
darker than Eugene, but they differed from him in this, that while he is a
man of color, they were not.&nbsp; For in America the man of Aryan blood,
however dark he may be, is always &ldquo;off&rdquo; color, while the
lightest-hued quadroon is always on it.&nbsp; Which is not the only paradox
connected with the descendants of Africans of which I have heard.</p>
<p>I saw at a glance that these dark men were much nearer to the old Aryan
stock than are even my purely white readers.&nbsp; For they were more
recently from India, and they could speak a language abounding in Hindi, in
pure old Sanskrit, and in Persian.&nbsp; Yet they would make no display of
it; on the contrary, I knew that they would be very likely at first to deny
all knowledge thereof, as well as their race and blood.&nbsp; For they were
gypsies; it was very apparent in their eyes, which had the Gitano gleam as
one seldom sees it in England.&nbsp; I confess that I experienced a thrill
as I exchanged glances with <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>them.&nbsp; It was a long time since I had seen
a Romany, and, as usual, I knew that I was going to astonish them.&nbsp;
They were singularly attired, having very good clothes of a quite
theatrical foreign fashion, bearing silver buttons as large as and of the
shape of hen&rsquo;s eggs.&nbsp; Their hair hung in black ringlets down
their shoulders, and I saw that they had come from the Austrian Slavonian
land.</p>
<p>I addressed the eldest in Italian.&nbsp; He answered fluently and
politely.&nbsp; I changed to Ilirski or Illyrian and to Serb, of which I
have a few phrases in stock.&nbsp; They spoke all these languages fluently,
for one was a born Illyrian and one a Serb.&nbsp; They also spoke Nemetz,
or German; in fact, everything except English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got through all your languages?&rdquo; I at last
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tutte, signore,&mdash;all of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there <i>one</i> left behind, which you have
forgotten?&nbsp; Think a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, signore.&nbsp; None.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, not <i>one</i>!&nbsp; You know so many that perhaps a
language more or less makes no difference to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the Lord, signore, you have seen every egg in the
basket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked him fixedly in the eyes, and said, in a low tone,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ne rakesa tu Romanes miro prala</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a startled glance from one to the other, and a silence.&nbsp;
I had asked him if he could not talk Romany.&nbsp; And I added,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Won&rsquo;t</i> you talk a word with a gypsy
brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>That</i> moved them.&nbsp; They all shook my hands with <!-- page
93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>great feeling,
expressing intense joy and amazement at meeting with one who knew them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mishto hom me dikava tute</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; (I am glad to see
you.)&nbsp; So they told me how they were getting on, and where they were
camped, and how they sold horses, and so on, and we might have got on much
farther had it not been for a very annoying interruption.&nbsp; As I was
talking to the gypsies, a great number of men, attracted by the sound of a
foreign language, stopped, and fairly pushed themselves up to us,
endeavoring to make it all out.&nbsp; When there were at least fifty, they
crowded in between me and the foreigners, so that I could hardly talk to
them.&nbsp; The crowd did not consist of ordinary people, or snobs.&nbsp;
They were well dressed,&mdash;young clerks, at least,&mdash;who would have
fiercely resented being told that they were impertinent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eye-talians, ain&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; inquired one man, who was
evidently zealous in pursuit of knowledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell us what they are
sayin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of fellers air they, any way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was desirous of going with the Hungarian Roms.&nbsp; But to walk along
Chestnut Street with an augmenting procession of fifty curious Sunday
promenaders was not on my card.&nbsp; In fact, I had some difficulty in
tearing myself from the inquisitive, questioning, well-dressed
people.&nbsp; The gypsies bore the pressure with the serene equanimity of
cosmopolite superiority, smiling at provincial rawness.&nbsp; Even so in
China and Africa the traveler is mobbed by the many, who, there as here,
think that &ldquo;I want to know&rdquo; is full excuse for all
intrusiveness.&nbsp; <i>Q&rsquo;est tout comme chez nous</i>.&nbsp; I
confess that I was vexed, and, considering that it was in my native city,
mortified.</p>
<p><!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>A
few days after I went out to the <i>tan</i> where these Roms had
camped.&nbsp; But the birds had flown, and a little pile of ashes and the
usual d&eacute;bris of a gypsy camp were all that remained.&nbsp; The
police told me that they had some very fine horses, and had gone to the
Northwest; and that is all I ever saw of them.</p>
<p>I have heard of a philanthropist who was turned into a misanthrope by
attempting to sketch in public and in galleries.&nbsp; Respectable
strangers, even clergymen, would stop and coolly look over his shoulder,
and ask questions, and give him advice, until he could work no
longer.&nbsp; Why is it that people who would not speak to you for life
without an introduction should think that their small curiosity to see your
sketches authorizes them to act as aquaintances?&nbsp; Or why is the
pursuit of knowledge assumed among the half-bred to be an excuse for so
much intrusion?&nbsp; &ldquo;I want to know.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, and what if
you do?&nbsp; The man who thinks that his desire for knowledge is an excuse
for impertinence&mdash;and there are too many who act on this in all
sincerity&mdash;is of the kind who knocks the fingers off statues, because
&ldquo;he wants them&rdquo; for his collection; who chips away tombstones,
and hews down historic trees, and not infrequently steals outright, and
thinks that his pretense of culture is full excuse for all his mean
deeds.&nbsp; Of this tribe is the man who cuts his name on all walls and
smears it on the pyramids, to proclaim himself a fool to the world; the
difference being that, instead of wanting to know anything, he wants
everybody to know that His Littleness was once in a great place.</p>
<p>I knew a distinguished artist, who, while in the East, only secured his
best sketch of a landscape by employing fifty men to keep off the
multitude.&nbsp; I <!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>have seen a strange fellow take a lady&rsquo;s
sketch out of her hand, excusing himself with the remark that he was so
fond of pictures.&nbsp; Of course my readers do not act thus.&nbsp; When
they are passing through the Louvre or British Museum they never pause and
overlook artists, despite the notices requesting them not to do so.&nbsp;
Of course not.&nbsp; Yet I once knew a charming young American lady, who
scouted the idea as nonsense that she should not watch artists at
work.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, we used to make up parties for the purpose of
looking at them!&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was half the fun of going
there.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure the artists were delighted to get a chance to
talk to us.&rdquo;&nbsp; Doubtless.&nbsp; And yet there are really very few
artists who do not work more at their ease when not watched, and I have
known some to whom such watching was misery.&nbsp; They are not, O
intruder, painting for <i>your</i> amusement!</p>
<p>This is not such a far cry from my Romanys as it may seem.&nbsp; When I
think of what I have lost in this life by impertinence coming between me
and gypsies, I feel that it could not be avoided.&nbsp; The proportion of
men, even of gentlemen, or of those who dress decently, who cannot see
another well-dressed man talking with a very poor one in public, without at
once surmising a mystery, and endeavoring to solve it, is amazing.&nbsp;
And they do not stop at a trifle, either.</p>
<p>It is a marked characteristic of all gypsies that they are quite free
from any such mean intrusiveness.&nbsp; Whether it is because they
themselves are continually treated as curiosities, or because great
knowledge of life in a small way has made them philosophers, I will not
say, but it is a fact that in <!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>this respect they are invariably the politest
people in the world.&nbsp; Perhaps their calm contempt of the
<i>galerly</i>, or green Gorgios, is founded on a consciousness of their
superiority in this matter.</p>
<p>The Hungarian gypsy differs from all his brethren of Europe in being
more intensely gypsy.&nbsp; He has deeper, wilder, and more original
feeling in music, and he is more inspired with a love of travel.&nbsp;
Numbers of Hungarian Romany chals&mdash;in which I include all Austrian
gypsies&mdash;travel annually all over Europe, but return as regularly to
their own country.&nbsp; I have met with them exhibiting bears in
Baden-Baden.&nbsp; These Ri&#269;inari, or bear-leaders, form, however, a
set within a set, and are in fact more nearly allied to the gypsy
bear-leaders of Turkey and Syria than to any other of their own
people.&nbsp; They are wild and rude to a proverb, and generally speak a
peculiar dialect of Romany, which is called the Bear-leaders&rsquo; by
philologists.&nbsp; I have also seen Syrian-gypsy Ri&#269;inari in
Cairo.&nbsp; Many of the better caste make a great deal of money, and some
are rich.&nbsp; Like all really pure-blooded gypsies, they have deep
feelings, which are easily awakened by kindness, but especially by sympathy
and interest.</p>

97</span>ENGLISH GYPSIES.</h2>
<h3>I.&nbsp; OATLANDS PARK.</h3>
<p>Oatlands Park (between Weybridge and Walton-upon-Thames) was once the
property of the Duke of York, but now the lordly manor-house is a
hotel.&nbsp; The grounds about it are well preserved and very
picturesque.&nbsp; They should look well, for they cover a vast and wasted
fortune.&nbsp; There is, for instance, a grotto which cost forty thousand
pounds.&nbsp; It is one of those wretched and tasteless masses of silly
rock-rococo work which were so much admired at the beginning of the present
century, when sham ruins and sham caverns were preferred to real.&nbsp;
There is, also, close by the grotto, a dogs&rsquo; burial-ground, in which
more than a hundred animals, the favorites of the late duchess, lie
buried.&nbsp; Over each is a tombstone, inscribed with a rhyming epitaph,
written by the titled lady herself, and which is in sober sadness in every
instance doggerel, as befits the subject.&nbsp; In order to degrade the
associations of religion and church rites as effectually as possible, there
is attached to these graves the semblance of a ruined chapel, the
stained-glass window of which was taken from a church. <a
name="citation97"></a><a href="#footnote97" class="citation">[97]</a>&nbsp;
I confess that I could never see either <!-- page 98--><a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>grotto or grave-yard
without sincerely wishing, out of regard to the memory of both duke and
duchess, that these ridiculous relics of vulgar taste and affected
sentimentalism could be completely obliterated.&nbsp; But, apart from them,
the scenes around are very beautiful; for there are grassy slopes and
pleasant lawns, ancient trees and broad gravel walks, over which, as the
dry leaves fall on the crisp sunny morning, the feet are tempted to walk on
and on, all through the merry golden autumn day.</p>
<p>The neighborhood abounds in memories of olden time.&nbsp; Near Oatlands
is a modernized house, in which Henry the Eighth lived in his youth.&nbsp;
It belonged then to Cardinal Wolsey; now it is owned by Mr.
Lindsay,&mdash;a sufficient cause for wits calling it Lindsay-Wolsey, that
being also a &ldquo;fabric.&rdquo;&nbsp; Within an hour&rsquo;s walk is the
palace built by Cardinal Wolsey, while over the river, and visible from the
portico, is the little old Gothic church of Shepperton, and in the same
view, to the right, is the old Walton Bridge, by Cowie Stakes, supposed to
cover the exact spot where C&aelig;sar crossed.&nbsp; This has been denied
by many, but I know that the field adjacent to it abounds in ancient
British jars filled with burned bones, the relics of an ancient
battle,&mdash;probably that which legend states was fought on the
neighboring Battle Island.&nbsp; Stout-hearted Queen Bessy has also left
her mark on this neighborhood, for within a mile is the old Saxon-towered
church of Walton, in which the royal dame was asked for her opinion of the
sacrament when it was given to her, to which she replied:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Christ was the Word who spake it,<br />
He took the bread and brake it;<br />
And what that Word did make it,<br />
That I believe, and take it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>In
memory of this the lines were inscribed on the massy Norman pillar by which
she stood.&nbsp; From the style and cutting it is evident that the
inscription dates from the reign of Elizabeth.&nbsp; And very near
Oatlands, in fact on the grounds, there are two ancient yew-trees, several
hundred yards apart.&nbsp; The story runs that Queen Elizabeth once drew a
long bow and shot an arrow so far that, to commemorate the deed, one of
these trees was planted where she stood, and the other where the shaft
fell.&nbsp; All England is a museum of touching or quaint relics; to me one
of its most interesting cabinets is this of the neighborhood of Weybridge
and Walton-upon-Thames.</p>
<p>I once lived for eight months at Oatlands Park, and learned to know the
neighborhood well.&nbsp; I had many friends among the families in the
vicinity, and, guided by their advice, wandered to every old church and
manor-house, ruin and haunted rock, fairy-oak, tower, palace, or shrine
within a day&rsquo;s ramble.&nbsp; But there was one afternoon walk of four
miles, round by the river, which I seldom missed.&nbsp; It led by a spot on
the bank, and an old willow-tree near the bridge, which spot was greatly
haunted by the Romany, so that, excepting during the hopping-season of
autumn, when they were away in Kent, I seldom failed to see from afar a
light rising smoke, and near it a tent and a van, as the evening shadows
blended with the mist from the river in phantom union.</p>
<p>It is a common part of gypsy life that the father shall be away all day,
lounging about the next village, possibly in the <i>kitchema</i> or
ale-house, or trying to trade a horse, while the wife trudges over the
country, from one farm-house or cottage to another, <!-- page 100--><a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>loaded with baskets,
household utensils, toys, or cheap ornaments, which she endeavors, like a
true Autolyca, with wily arts and wheedling tones, to sell to the
rustics.&nbsp; When it can be managed, this hawking is often an
introduction to fortune-telling, and if these fail the gypsy has recourse
to begging.&nbsp; But it is a weary life, and the poor <i>dye</i> is always
glad enough to get home.&nbsp; During the day the children have been left
to look out for themselves or to the care of the eldest, and have tumbled
about the van, rolled around with the dog, and fought or frolicked as they
chose.&nbsp; But though their parents often have a stock of cheap toys,
especially of penny dolls and the like, which they put up as prizes for
games at races and fairs, I have never seen these children with
playthings.&nbsp; The little girls have no dolls; the boys, indeed, affect
whips, as becomes incipient jockeys, but on the whole they never seemed to
me to have the same ideas as to play as ordinary house-children.&nbsp; The
author of &ldquo;My Indian Garden&rdquo; has made the same observation of
Hindoo little ones, whose ways are not as our ways were when we were
young.&nbsp; Roman and Egyptian children had their dolls; and there is
something sadly sweet to me in the sight of these barbarous and na&iuml;ve
facsimiles of miniature humanity, which come up like little spectres out of
the dust of ancient days.&nbsp; They are so rude and queer, these Roman
puppets; and yet they were loved once, and had pet names, and their
owl-like faces were as tenderly kissed as their little mistresses had been
by their mothers.&nbsp; So the Romany girl, unlike the Roman, is generally
doll-less and toy-less.&nbsp; But the affection between mother and child is
as warm among these wanderers as with any other people; and it is a
touching sight to see the gypsy who <!-- page 101--><a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>has been absent all
the weary day returning home.&nbsp; And when she is seen from afar off
there is a race among all the little dark-brown things to run to mother and
get kissed, and cluster and scramble around her, and perhaps receive some
little gift which mother&rsquo;s thoughtful love has provided.&nbsp;
Knowing these customs, I was wont to fill my pockets with chestnuts or
oranges, and, distributing them among the little ones, talk with them, and
await the sunset return of their parents.&nbsp; The confidence or love of
all children is delightful; but that of gypsy children resembles the
friendship of young foxes, and the study of their artless-artful ways is
indeed attractive.&nbsp; I can remember that one afternoon six small Romany
boys implored me to give them each a penny.&nbsp; I replied,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had sixpence, how would you divide it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be a penny apiece,&rdquo; said the eldest boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if threepence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A ha&rsquo;penny apiece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And three ha&rsquo;pence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A farden all round.&nbsp; And then it couldn&rsquo;t go no
furder, unless we bought tobacco an&rsquo; diwided it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I have some tobacco.&nbsp; But can any of you
smoke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were from four to ten years of age, and at the word every one
pulled out the stump of a blackened pipe,&mdash;such depraved-looking
fragments I never saw,&mdash;and holding them all up, and crowding closely
around, like hungry poultry with uplifted bills, they began to clamor for
<i>t&#363;valo</i>, or tobacco.&nbsp; They were connoisseurs, too, and the
elder boy, as he secured his share, smelled it with intense satisfaction,
and <!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s <i>rye&rsquo;s t&#363;valo</i>;&rdquo;
that is, &ldquo;gentleman&rsquo;s tobacco,&rdquo; or best quality.</p>
<p>One evening, as the shadows were darkening the day, I met a little gypsy
boy, dragging along, with incredible labor, a sack full of wood, which one
needed not go far afield to surmise was neither purchased nor begged.&nbsp;
The alarmed and guilty or despairing look which he cast at me was very
touching.&nbsp; Perhaps he thought I was the gentleman upon whose property
he had &ldquo;found&rdquo; the wood; or else a magistrate.&nbsp; How he
stared when I spoke to him in Romany, and offered to help him carry
it!&nbsp; As we bore it along I suggested that we had better be careful and
avoid the police, which remark established perfect confidence between
us.&nbsp; But as we came to the tent, what was the amazement of the
boy&rsquo;s mother to see him returning with a gentleman helping him to
carry his load!&nbsp; And to hear me say in Romany, and in a cheerful tone,
&ldquo;Mother, here is some wood we&rsquo;ve been stealing for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gypsies have strong nerves and much cheek, but this was beyond her
endowment; she was appalled at the unearthly strangeness of the whole
proceeding, and when she spoke there was a skeleton rattle in her words and
a quaver of startled ghastliness in her laugh.&nbsp; She had been alarmed
for her boy, and when I appeared she thought I was a swell bringing him in
under arrest; but when I announced myself in Romany as an accomplice,
emotion stifled thought.&nbsp; And I lingered not, and spoke no more, but
walked away into the woods and the darkness.&nbsp; However, the legend went
forth on the roads, even unto Kingston, and was told among the rollicking
Romanys of &rsquo;Appy Ampton; for there are always a merry, loafing lot
<!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>of
them about that festive spot, looking out for excursionists through the
months when the gorse blooms, and kissing is in season&mdash;which is
always.&nbsp; And he who seeks them on Sunday may find them camped in Green
Lane.</p>
<p>When I wished for a long ramble on the hedge-lined roads&mdash;the sweet
roads of old England&mdash;and by the green fields, I was wont to take a
day&rsquo;s walk to Netley Abbey.&nbsp; Then I could pause, as I went,
before many a quiet, sheltered spot, adorned with arbors and green alleys,
and protected by trees and hawthorn hedges, and again surrender my soul,
while walking, to tender and vague reveries, in which all definite thoughts
swim overpowered, yet happy, in a sea of voluptuous emotions inspired by
clouds lost in the blue sea of heaven and valleys visioned away into the
purple sky.&nbsp; What opium is to one, what hasheesh may be to another,
what <i>kheyf</i> or mere repose concentrated into actuality is to the
Arab, that is Nature to him who has followed her for long years through
poets and mystics and in works of art, until at last he pierces through
dreams and pictures to reality.</p>
<p>The ruins of Netley Abbey, nine or ten miles from Oatlands Park, are
picturesque and lonely, and well fitted for the dream-artist in shadows
among sunshine.&nbsp; The priory was called Newstead or De Novo Loco in
Norman times, when it was founded by Ruald de Calva, in the day of Richard
C&oelig;ur de Lion.&nbsp; The ruins rise gray, white, and undressed with
ivy, that they may contrast the more vividly with the deep emerald of the
meadows around.&nbsp; &ldquo;The surrounding scenery is composed of rivers
and rivulets,&rdquo;&mdash;for seven streams run by it, according to
Aubrey,&mdash;&ldquo;of <!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>foot-bridge and fords, plashy pools and
fringed, tangled hollows, trees in groups or alone, and cattle dotted over
the pastures:&rdquo; an English Cuyp from many points of view, beautiful
and English-home-like from all.&nbsp; Very near it is the quaint,
out-of-the-way, darling little old church of Pirford, up a hill, nestling
among trees, a half-Norman, decorated beauty, out of the age, but
altogether in the heart.&nbsp; As I came near, of a summer afternoon, the
waving of leaves and the buzzing of bees without, and the hum of the voices
of children at school within the adjoining building, the cool shade and the
beautiful view of the ruined Abbey beyond, made an impression which I can
never forget.&nbsp; Among such scenes one learns why the English love so
heartily their rural life, and why every object peculiar to it has brought
forth a picture or a poem.&nbsp; I can imagine how many a man, who has
never known what poetry was at home, has wept with yearning inexpressible,
when sitting among burning sands and under the palms of the East, for such
scenes as these.</p>
<p>But Netley Abbey is close by the river Wey, and the sight of that river
and the thought of the story of the monks of the olden time who dwelt in
the Abbey drive away sentiment as suddenly as a north wind scatters
sea-fogs.&nbsp; For the legend is a merry one, and the reader may have
heard it; but if he has not I will give it in one of the merriest ballads
ever written.&nbsp; By whom I know not,&mdash;doubtless many know.&nbsp; I
sing, while walking, songs of olden time.</p>

105</span>THE MONKS OF THE WEY.</h4>
<p>A TRUE AND IMPORTANT RELATION OF THE WONDERFUL TUNNELL OF NEWARKE ABBEY
AND OF THE UNTIMELY ENDE OF SEVERALL OF YE GHOSTLY BRETH&rsquo;REN.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The monks of the Wey seldom sung any psalms,<br />
And little they thought of religion or qualms;<br />
Such rollicking, frolicking, ranting, and gay,<br />
And jolly old boys were the monks of the Wey.</p>
<p>To the sweet nuns of Ockham devoting their cares,<br />
They had little time for their beads and their prayers;<br />
For the love of these maidens they sighed night and day,<br />
And neglected devotion, these monks of the Wey.</p>
<p>And happy i&rsquo; faith might these brothers have been<br />
If the river had never been rolling between<br />
The abbey so grand and the convent so gray,<br />
That stood on the opposite side of the Wey.</p>
<p>For daily they sighed, and then nightly they pined<br />
But little to anchorite precepts inclined,<br />
So smitten with beauty&rsquo;s enchantments were they,<br />
These rollicking, frolicking monks of the Wey.</p>
<p>But scandal was rife in the country near,<br />
They dared not row over the river for fear;<br />
And no more could they swim it, so fat were they,<br />
These oily and amorous monks of the Wey.</p>
<p>Loudly they groaned for their fate so hard,<br />
From the love of these beautiful maidens debarred,<br />
Till a brother just hit on a plan which would stay<br />
The woe of these heart-broken monks of the Wey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;should true love sunder;<br />
Since we cannot go over, then let us go under!<br />
Boats and bridges shall yield to clay,<br />
We&rsquo;ll dig a long tunnel clean under the Wey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So to it they went with right good will,<br />
With spade and shovel and pike and bill;<br />
<!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>And from evening&rsquo;s close till the dawn of day<br />
They worked like miners all under the Wey.</p>
<p>And at vesper hour, as their work begun,<br />
Each sung of the charms of his favorite nun;<br />
&ldquo;How surprised they will be, and how happy!&rdquo; said they,<br />
&ldquo;When we pop in upon them from under the Wey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And for months they kept grubbing and making no sound<br />
Like other black moles, darkly under the ground;<br />
And no one suspected such going astray,<br />
So sly were these mischievous monks of the Wey.</p>
<p>At last their fine work was brought near to a close<br />
And early one morn from their pallets they rose,<br />
And met in their tunnel with lights to survey<br />
If they&rsquo;d scooped a free passage right under the Wey.</p>
<p>But alas for their fate!&nbsp; As they smirked and they smiled.<br />
To think how completely the world was beguiled,<br />
The river broke in, and it grieves me to say<br />
It drowned all the frolicksome monks of the Wey.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>O churchmen beware of the lures of the flesh,<br />
The net of the devil has many a mesh!<br />
And remember whenever you&rsquo;re tempted to stray,<br />
The fate that befell the poor monks of the Wey.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was all long ago, and now there are neither monks nor nuns; the
convent has been converted, little by little, age by age, into cottages,
even as the friars and nuns themselves may have been organically changed
possibly into violets, but more probably into the festive sparrows which
flit and hop and flirt about the ruins with abrupt startles, like pheasants
sudden bursting on the wing.&nbsp; There is a pretty little Latin epigram,
written by a gay monk, of a pretty little lady, who, being very amorous,
and observing that sparrows were like her as to love, hoped that she might
be turned into one after death; and it is not <!-- page 107--><a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>difficult for a
dreamer in an old abbey, of a golden day to fancy that these merry, saucy
birdies, who dart and dip in and out of the sunshine or shadow, chirping
their shameless ditties <i>pro et con</i>, were once the human dwellers in
the spot, who sang their gaudrioles to pleasant strains.</p>
<p>I became familiar with many such scenes for many miles about Oatlands,
not merely during solitary walks, but by availing myself of the kind
invitations of many friends, and by hunting afoot with the beagles.&nbsp;
In this fashion one has hare and hound, but no horse.&nbsp; It is not
needed, for while going over crisp stubble and velvet turf, climbing fences
and jumping ditches, a man has a keen sense of being his own horse, and
when he accomplishes a good leap of being intrinsically well worth
&pound;200.&nbsp; And indeed, so long as anybody can walk day in and out a
greater distance than would tire a horse, he may well believe he is really
worth one.&nbsp; It may be a good thing for us to reflect on the fact that
if slavery prevailed at the present day as it did among the polished Greeks
the average price of young gentlemen, and even of young ladies, would not
be more than what is paid for a good hunter.&nbsp; Divested of diamonds and
of Worth&rsquo;s dresses, what would a girl of average charms be worth to a
stranger?&nbsp; Let us reflect!</p>
<p>It was an October morning, and, pausing after a run, I let the pack and
the &ldquo;course-men&rdquo; sweep away, while I sat in a pleasant spot to
enjoy the air and scenery.&nbsp; The solemn grandeur of groves and the
quiet dignity of woodland glades, barred with rays of solid-seeming
sunshine, such as the saint of old hung his cloak on, the brook into which
the overhanging chestnuts drop, as if in sport, their creamy <!-- page
108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>golden
little boats of leaves, never seem so beautiful or impressive as
immediately after a rush and cry of many men, succeeded by solitude and
silence.&nbsp; Little by little the bay of the hounds, the shouts of the
hunters, and the occasional sound of the horn grew fainter; the birds once
more appeared, and sent forth short calls to their timid friends.&nbsp; I
began again to notice who my neighbors were, as to daisies and heather
which resided around the stone on which I sat, and the exclusive circle of
a fairy-ring at a little distance, which, like many exclusive circles,
consisted entirely of mushrooms.</p>
<p>As the beagle-sound died away, and while the hounds were &ldquo;working
around&rdquo; to the road, I heard footsteps approaching, and looking up
saw before me a gypsy woman and a boy.&nbsp; She was a very gypsy woman, an
ideal witch, nut-brown, tangle-haired, aquiline of nose, and fierce-eyed;
and fiercely did she beg!&nbsp; As amid broken Gothic ruins, overhung with
unkempt ivy, one can trace a vanished and strange beauty, so in this worn
face of the Romany, mantled by neglected tresses, I could see the remains
of what must have been once a wonderful though wild loveliness.&nbsp; As I
looked into those serpent eyes; trained for a long life to fascinate in
fortune-telling simple dove-girls, I could readily understand the implicit
faith with which many writers in the olden time spoke of the
&ldquo;fascination&rdquo; peculiar to female glances.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
multiplication of women,&rdquo; said the rabbis, &ldquo;is the increase of
witches,&rdquo; for the belles in Israel were killing girls, with arrows,
the bows whereof are formed by pairs of jet-black eyebrows joined in
one.&nbsp; And thus it was that these black-eyed beauties, by
<i>mashing</i> <a name="citation108"></a><a href="#footnote108"
class="citation">[108]</a> men for <!-- page 109--><a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>many generations,
with shafts shot sideways and most wantonly, at last sealed their souls
into the corner of their eyes, as you have heard before.&nbsp; Cotton
Mather tells us that these witches with peaked eye-corners could never weep
but three tears out of their long-tailed eyes.&nbsp; And I have observed
that such tears, as they sweep down the cheeks of the brunette witches, are
also long-tailed, and recall by their shape and glitter the eyes from which
they fell, even as the daughter recalls the mother.&nbsp; For all
love&rsquo;s witchcraft lurks in flashing eyes,&mdash;<i>lontan del occhio
lontan dal&rsquo; cuor</i>.</p>
<p>It is a great pity that the pigeon-eye-peaks, so pretty in young
witches, become in the old ones crow&rsquo;s-feet and crafty.&nbsp; When I
greeted the woman, she answered in Romany, and said she was a Stanley from
the North.&nbsp; She lied bravely, and I told her so.&nbsp; It made no
difference in any way, nor was she hurt.&nbsp; The brown boy, who seemed
like a goblin, umber-colored fungus, growing by a snaky black wild vine,
sat by her and stared at me.&nbsp; I was pleased, when he said
<i>tober</i>, that she corrected him, exclaiming earnestly, &ldquo;Never
say <i>tober</i> for road; that is <i>canting</i>.&nbsp; Always say
<i>drom</i>; that is good Romanes.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is always a way of
bringing up a child in the way he should go,&mdash;though it be a gypsy
one,&mdash;and <i>drom</i> comes from the Greek <i>dromos</i>, which is
elegant and classical.&nbsp; Then she began to beg again, to pass the time,
and I lectured her severely on the sin and meanness of her conduct, and
said, with bitterness, &ldquo;Do dogs eat dogs, or are all the Gorgios dead
in the land, that you cry for money to me?&nbsp; Oh, you are a fine
Stanley! a nice Beshaley you, to sing mumpin and mongerin, when a
half-blood Matthews <!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>has too much decency to trouble the rye!&nbsp;
And how much will you take?&nbsp; Whatever the gentleman pleases, and thank
you, my kind sir, and the blessings of the poor gypsy woman on you.&nbsp;
Yes, I know that, <i>givelli</i>, you mother of all the liars.&nbsp; You
expect a sixpence, and here it is, and may you get drunk on the money, and
be well thrashed by your man for it.&nbsp; And now see what I had in my
hand all the time to give you.&nbsp; A lucky half crown, my deary; but
that&rsquo;s not for you now.&nbsp; I only give a sixpence to a beggar, but
I stand a <i>pash-korauna</i> to any Romany who&rsquo;s a pal and
am&#257;l.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This pleasing discourse made us very good friends, and, as I kept my
eyes sharply fixed on her viper orbs with an air of intense suspicion,
everything like ill-feeling or distrust naturally vanished from her mind;
for it is of the nature of the Romanys and all their kind to like those
whom they respect, and respect those whom they cannot deceive, and to
measure mankind exactly by their capacity of being taken in, especially by
themselves.&nbsp; As is also the case, in good society, with many ladies
and some gentlemen,&mdash;and much good may it do them!</p>
<p>There was a brief silence, during which the boy still looked wistfully
into my face, as if wondering what kind of gentleman I might be, until his
mother said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do with them <i>ryas</i> [swells]?&nbsp; What do you
tell &rsquo;em&mdash;about&mdash;what do they think&mdash;you
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was not explicit, but I understood it perfectly.&nbsp; There is a
great deal of such loose, disjointed conversation among gypsies and other
half-thinkers.&nbsp; An educated man requires, or pretends to himself to
require, <!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>a most accurately-detailed and form-polished statement of
anything to understand it.&nbsp; The gypsy is less exacting.&nbsp; I have
observed among rural Americans much of this lottery style of conversation,
in which one man invests in a dubious question, not knowing exactly what
sort of a prize or blank answer he may draw.&nbsp; What the gypsy meant
effectively was, &ldquo;How do you account to the Gorgios for knowing so
much about us, and talking with us?&nbsp; Our life is as different from
yours as possible, and you never acquired such a knowledge of all our
tricky ways as you have just shown without much experience of us and a
double life.&nbsp; You are related to us in some way, and you deceive the
Gorgios about it.&nbsp; What is your little game of life, on general
principles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the gypsy is so little accustomed to having any congenial interest
taken in him that he can clearly explain it only by consanguinity.&nbsp;
And as I was questioned, so I answered,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I tell them I like to learn languages, and am trying to
learn yours; and then I&rsquo;m a foreigner in the country, anyhow, and
they don&rsquo;t know my <i>droms</i> [ways], and they don&rsquo;t care
much what I do,&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was perfectly satisfactory, and as the hounds came sweeping round
the corner of the wood she rose and went her way, and I saw her growing
less and less along the winding road and up the hill, till she disappeared,
with her boy, in a small ale-house.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bang went the
sixpence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the last red light was in the west I went down to the river, and as
I paused, and looked alternately at the stars reflected and flickering in
the water and at the lights in the little gypsy camp, <!-- page 112--><a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>I thought that as the
dancing, restless, and broken sparkles were to their serene types above,
such were the wandering and wild Romany to the men of culture in their
settled homes.&nbsp; It is from the house-dweller that the men of the roads
and commons draw the elements of their life, but in that life they are as
shaken and confused as the starlight in the rippling river.&nbsp; But if we
look through our own life we find that it is not the gypsy alone who is
merely a reflection and an imitation of the stars above him, and a creature
of second-hand fashion.</p>
<p>I found in the camp an old acquaintance, named Brown, and also perceived
at the first greeting that the woman Stanley had told Mrs. Brown that I
would not be <i>mongerdo</i>, or begged from, and that the latter, proud of
her power in extortion, and as yet invincible in mendicancy, had boasted
that she would succeed, let others weakly fail.&nbsp; And to lose no time
she went at me with an abruptness and dramatic earnestness which promptly
betrayed the secret.&nbsp; And on the spot I made a vow that nothing should
get a farthing from me, though I should be drawn by wild horses.&nbsp; And
a horse was, indeed, brought into requisition to draw me, or my money, but
without success; for Mr. Brown, as I very well knew,&mdash;it being just
then the current topic in the best society on the road,&mdash;had very
recently been involved in a tangled trouble with a stolen horse.&nbsp; This
horse had been figuratively laid at his door, even as a
&ldquo;love-babe&rdquo; is sometimes placed on the front steps of a
virtuous and grave citizen,&mdash;at least, this is what White George
averred,&mdash;and his very innocence and purity had, like a shining mark,
attracted the shafts of the wicked.&nbsp; He had come out unscathed, <!--
page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>with a
package of papers from a lawyer, which established his character above par;
but all this had cost money, beautiful golden money, and brought him to the
very brink of ruin!&nbsp; Mrs. Brown&rsquo;s attack was a desperate and
determined effort, and there was more at stake on its success than the
reader may surmise.&nbsp; Among gypsy women skill in begging implies the
possession of every talent which they most esteem, such as artfulness, cool
effrontery, and the power of moving pity or provoking generosity by pique
or humor.&nbsp; A quaint and racy book might be written, should it only set
forth the manner in which the experienced matrons give straight-tips or
suggestions to the maidens as to the manner and lore of begging; and it is
something worth hearing when several sit together and devise dodges, and
tell anecdotes illustrating the noble art of mendicity, and how it should
be properly practiced.</p>
<p>Mrs. Brown knew that to extort alms from me would place her on the
pinnacle as an artist.&nbsp; Among all the Cooper clan, to which she was
allied, there was not one who ever begged from me, they having all found
that the ripest nuts are those which fall from the tree of their own
accord, or are blown earthward by the soft breezes of benevolence, and not
those which are violently beaten down.&nbsp; She began by pitiful appeals;
she was moving, but I did not budge.&nbsp; She grew pathetic; she touched
on the stolen horse; she paused, and gushed almost to tears, as much as to
say, If it must be, you <i>shall</i> know all.&nbsp; Ruin stared them in
the face; poverty was crushing them.&nbsp; It was well acted,&mdash;rather
in the Bernhardt style, which, if M. Ondit speaks the truth, is also
employed rather extensively for acquiring &ldquo;de monish.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>I
looked at the van, of which the Browns are proud, and inquired if it were
true that it had been insured for a hundred pounds, as George had recently
boasted.&nbsp; Persuasion having failed, Mrs. Brown tried bold defiance,
saying that they needed no company who were no good to them, and plainly
said to me I might be gone.&nbsp; It was her last card, thinking that a
threat to dissolve our acquaintance would drive me to capitulate, and it
failed.&nbsp; I laughed, went into the van, sat down, took out my brandy
flask, and then accepted some bread and ale, and, to please them, read
aloud all the papers acquitting George from all guilt as concerned the
stolen horse,&mdash;papers which, he declared, had cost him full five
pounds.&nbsp; This was a sad come-down from the story first told.&nbsp;
Then I seriously rated his wife for begging from me.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know
well enough,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that I give all I can spare to your
family and your people when they are sick or poor.&nbsp; And here you are,
the richest Romanys on the road between Windsor and the Boro Gav, begging a
friend, who knows all about you, for money!&nbsp; Now, here is a
shilling.&nbsp; Take it.&nbsp; Have half a crown?&nbsp; Two of
&rsquo;em!&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Oh, you don&rsquo;t want it here in your own
house.&nbsp; Well, you have some decency left, and to save your credit I
won&rsquo;t make you take it.&nbsp; And you scandalize me, a gentleman and
a friend, just to show this tramp of a Stanley <i>juva</i>, who
hasn&rsquo;t even got a drag [wagon], that you can beat her <i>a mongerin
mandy</i> [begging me].&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Brown assented volubly to everything, and all the time I saw in her
smiling eyes, ever agreeing to all, and heard from her voluble lips nothing
but the <i>lie</i>,&mdash;that lie which is the mental action and <!-- page
115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>inmost grain
of the Romany, and especially of the <i>diddikai</i>, or half-breed.&nbsp;
Anything and everything&mdash;trickery, wheedling or bullying, fawning or
threatening, smiles, or rage, or tears&mdash;for a sixpence.&nbsp; All day
long flattering and tricking to tell fortunes or sell trifles, and all life
one greasy lie, with ready frowns or smiles: as it was in India in the
beginning, as it is in Europe, and as it will be in America, so long as
there shall be a rambler on the roads, amen!</p>
<p>Sweet peace again established, Mrs. Brown became herself once more, and
acted the hospitable hostess, exactly in the spirit and manner of any woman
who has &ldquo;a home of her own,&rdquo; and a spark of decent feeling in
her heart.&nbsp; Like many actors, she was a bad lot on the boards, but a
very nice person off them.&nbsp; Here in her rolling home she was neither a
beggar nor poor, and she issued her orders grandly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Boil some
tea for the <i>rye</i>&mdash;cook some coffee for the <i>rye</i>&mdash;wait
a few minutes, my darling gentleman, and I&rsquo;ll brile you a
steak&mdash;or here&rsquo;s a fish, if you&rsquo;d like it?&rdquo;&nbsp;
But I declined everything except the corner of a loaf and some ale; and all
the time a little brown boy, with great black eyes, a perfect Murillo
model, sat condensed in wondrous narrow space by the fire, baking small
apples between the bars of the grate, and rolling up his orbs at me as if
wondering what could have brought me into such a circle,&mdash;even as he
had done that morning in the greenwood.</p>
<p>Now if the reader would know what the interior of a gypsy van, or
&ldquo;drag,&rdquo; or <i>wardo</i>, is like, he may see it in the

vans, purchased from gypsies, that Sir Samuel Baker and his wife explored
the whole of Cyprus.</p>
<p>Mrs. Brown was proud of her van and of her little treasures.&nbsp; From
the great recess under the bed she raked out as a rare curiosity an old
Dolly Varden or damasked skirt, not at all worn, quite pretty, and
evidently of considerable value to a collector.&nbsp; This had belonged to
Mrs. Brown&rsquo;s grandmother, an old gypsy queen.&nbsp; And it may be
observed, by the way, that the claims of every Irishman of every degree to
be descended from one of the ancient kings of Ireland fade into nothing
before those of the gypsy women, all of whom, with rare exception, are the
own daughters of royal personages, granddaughterhood being hardly a claim
to true nobility.&nbsp; Then the bed itself was exhibited with pride, and
the princess sang its praises, till she affirmed that the <i>rye</i>
himself did not sleep on a better one, for which George reprimanded
her.&nbsp; But she vigorously defended its excellence, and, to please her,
I felt it <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>and declared it was indeed much softer than the one I slept on,
which was really true,&mdash;thank Heaven&mdash;and was received as a great
compliment, and afterwards proclaimed on the roads even unto the ends of
Surrey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Brown, as I observed some osiers in the
cupboard, &ldquo;when I feels like it I sometimes makes a pound a day
a-making baskets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that it would be cheaper to
buy French baskets of Bulrose [Bulureaux] in Houndsditch, ready
made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So one would think; but the <i>ranyor</i> [osiers] costs
nothin&rsquo;, and so it&rsquo;s all profit, any way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I urged the greater profit of living in America, but both assured
me that so long as they could make a good living and be very comfortable,
as they considered themselves, in England, it would be nonsense to go to
America.</p>
<p>For all things are relative, and many a gypsy whom the begged-from pity
sincerely, is as proud and happy in a van as any lord in the land.&nbsp; A
very nice, neat young gypsy woman, camped long before just where the Browns
were, once said to me, &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t having everything fine and
stylish that makes you happy.&nbsp; Now we&rsquo;ve got a van, and have
everything so elegant and comfortable, and sleep warm as anybody; and yet I
often say to my husband that we used to be happier when we used to sleep
under a hedge with, may be, only a thin blanket, and wake up covered with
snow.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now this woman had only a wretched wagon, and was always
tramping in the rain, or cowering in a smoky, ragged tent and sitting on
the ground, but she had food, fire, and fun, with warm clothes, and
believed herself happy.&nbsp; Truly, she had <!-- page 118--><a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>better reason to
think so than any old maid with a heart run to waste on church gossip, or
the latest engagements and marriages; for it is better to be a street-boy
in a corner with a crust than one who, without it, discusses, in
starvation, with his friend the sausages and turtle-soup in a cook-shop
window, between which and themselves there is a great pane of glass fixed,
never to be penetrated.</p>

119</span>II.&nbsp; WALKING AND VISITING.</h3>
<p>I never shall forget the sparkling splendor of that frosty morning in
December when I went with a younger friend from Oatlands Park for a
day&rsquo;s walk.&nbsp; I may have seen at other times, but I do not
remember, such winter lace-work as then adorned the hedges.&nbsp; The
gossamer spider has within her an inward monitor which tells if the weather
will be fine; but it says nothing about sudden changes to keen cold, and
the artistic result was that the hedges were hung with thousands of Honiton
lamp-mats, instead of the thread fly-catchers which their little artists
had intended.&nbsp; And on twigs and dead leaves, grass and rock and wall,
were such expenditures of Brussels and Spanish point, such a luxury of real
old Venetian run mad, and such deliria of Russian lace as made it evident
that Mrs. Jack Frost is a very extravagant fairy, but one gifted with
exquisite taste.&nbsp; When I reflect how I have in my time spoken of the
taste for lace and diamonds in women as entirely without foundation in
nature, I feel that I sinned deeply.&nbsp; For Nature, in this lace-work,
displays at times a sympathy with humanity,&mdash;especially
womanity,&mdash;and coquets and flirts with it, as becomes the subject, in
a manner which is merrily awful.&nbsp; There was once in Philadelphia a
shop the windows of which were always filled with different kinds of the
richest <!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>and rarest lace, and one cold morning I found that the fairies
had covered the panes with literal frost fac-similes of the exquisite wares
which hung behind.&nbsp; This was no fancy; the copies were as accurate as
photographs.&nbsp; Can it be that in the invisible world there are Female
Fairy Schools of Design, whose scholars combine in this graceful style
Etching on Glass and Art Needlework?</p>
<p>We were going to the village of Hersham to make a call.&nbsp; It was not
at any stylish villa or lordly manor-house,&mdash;though I knew of more
than one in the vicinity where we would have been welcome,&mdash;but at a
rather disreputable-looking edifice, which bore on its front the sign of
&ldquo;Lodgings for Travellers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now &ldquo;traveller&rdquo;
means, below a certain circle of English life, not the occasional, but the
habitual wanderer, or one who dwells upon the roads, and gains his living
thereon.&nbsp; I have in my possession several cards of such a house.&nbsp;
I found them wrapped in a piece of paper, by a deserted gypsy camp, where
they had been lost:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">A NEW HOUSE.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Good Lodging for Travellers</i>.&nbsp;
<i>With a Large Private Kitchen</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">THE CROSS KEYS,<br />
<span class="smcap">West Street . . . maidenhead</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">BY J. HARRIS.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;private kitchen&rdquo; indicates that the guests will have
facilities for doing their own cooking, as all of them bring their own
victuals in perpetual picnic.&nbsp; In the inclosure of the house in
Hersham, the tops of two or three gypsy vans could always be seen above the
high fence, and there was that general <!-- page 121--><a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>air of mystery about
the entire establishment which is characteristic of all places haunted by
people whose ways are not as our ways, and whose little games are not as
our little games.&nbsp; I had become acquainted with it and its proprietor,
Mr. Hamilton, in that irregular and only way which is usual with such
acquaintances.&nbsp; I was walking by the house one summer day, and stopped
to ask my way.&nbsp; A handsome dark-brown girl was busy at the wash-tub,
two or three older women were clustered at the gate, and in all their faces
was the manner of the <i>diddikai</i> or <i>chureni</i>, or half-blood
gypsy.&nbsp; As I spoke I dropped my voice, and said,
inquiringly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Romanes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the confidential answer.</p>
<p>They were all astonished, and kept quiet till I had gone a few rods on
my way, when the whole party, recovering from their amazement, raised a
gentle cheer, expressive of approbation and sympathy.&nbsp; A few days
after, walking with a lady in Weybridge, she said to me,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that man who looked at you so closely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very strange.&nbsp; I am quite sure I heard him
utter two words in a strange language, as you passed, as if he only meant
them for you.&nbsp; They sounded like <i>sarshaun baw</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Which means, &ldquo;How are you, sir?&rdquo; or friend.&nbsp; As we came up
the street, I saw the man talking with a well-dressed, sporting-looking
man, not quite a gentleman, who sat cheekily in his own jaunty little
wagon.&nbsp; As I passed, the one of the wagon said to the other, speaking
of me, and in pure Romany, evidently thinking I did not
understand,&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>&ldquo;<i>Dikk&rsquo;adovo Giorgio</i>, <i>adoi</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp;
(Look at that Gorgio, there!)</p>
<p>Being a Romany rye, and not accustomed to be spoken of as a Gorgio, I
looked up at him, angrily, when he, seeing that I understood him, smiled,
and bowed politely in apology.&nbsp; I laughed and passed on.&nbsp; But I
thought it a little strange, for neither of the men had the slightest
indication of gypsiness.&nbsp; I met the one who had said <i>sarish&#257;n
b&#257;</i> again, soon after.&nbsp; I found that he and the one of the
wagon were not of gypsy blood, but of a class not uncommon in England, who,
be they rich or poor, are affected towards gypsies.&nbsp; The wealthy one
lived with a gypsy mistress; the poorer one had a gypsy wife, and was very
fond of the language.&nbsp; There is a very large class of these mysterious
men everywhere about the country.&nbsp; They haunt fairs; they pop up
unexpectedly as Jack-in-boxes in unsuspected guise; they look out from
under fatherly umbrellas; their name is Legion; their mother is Mystery,
and their uncle is Old Tom,&mdash;not of Virginia, but of Gin.&nbsp; Once,
in the old town of Canterbury, I stood in the street, under the Old Woman
with the Clock, one of the quaintest pieces of drollery ever imagined
during the Middle Ages.&nbsp; And by me was a tinker, and as his wheel went
<i>siz-&lsquo;z-&lsquo;z-&lsquo;z</i>, <i>uz-uz-uz-z-z</i>! I talked with
him, and there joined us a fat, little, elderly, spectacled,
shabby-genteel, but well-to-do-looking sort of a punchy, small
tradesman.&nbsp; And, as we spoke, there went by a great, stout, roaring
Romany woman,&mdash;a scarlet-runner of Babylon run to seed,&mdash;with a
boy and a hand-cart to carry the seed in.&nbsp; And to her I cried,
&ldquo;<i>Hav akai te mandy&rsquo;ll del tute a
sh&#257;ori</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; (Come here, and I&rsquo;ll stand a
sixpence!)&nbsp; But she did not <!-- page 123--><a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>believe in my offer,
but went her way, like a Burning Shame, through the crowd, and was lost
evermore.&nbsp; I looked at the little old gentleman to see what effect my
outcry in a strange language had upon him.&nbsp; But he only remarked,
soberly, &ldquo;Well, now, I <i>should</i> &rsquo;a&rsquo; thought a
sixpence would &rsquo;a&rsquo; brought her to!&rdquo;&nbsp; And the wheel
said, &ldquo;Suz-zuz-zuz-z-z I should &rsquo;a&rsquo; suz-suz
&rsquo;a&rsquo; thought a suz-z-zixpence would &rsquo;a&rsquo; suz-zuz
&rsquo;a&rsquo; brought her, too-z-z-z!&rdquo;&nbsp; And I looked at the
Old Woman with the Clock, and she ticked,
&ldquo;A&mdash;six&mdash;pence&mdash;would&mdash;have&mdash;brought&mdash;<i>me</i>&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&rdquo;&mdash;and
I began to dream that all Canterbury was Romany.</p>
<p>We came to the house, the landlord was up-stairs, ill in bed, but would
be glad to see us; and he welcomed us warmly, and went deeply into Romany
family matters with my friend, the Oxford scholar.&nbsp; Meanwhile, his
daughter, a nice brunette, received and read a letter; and he tried to
explain to me the mystery of the many men who are not gypsies, yet speak
Romany, but could not do it, though he was one of them.&nbsp; It appeared
from his account that they were &ldquo;a kind of mixed, you see, and dusted
in, you know, and on it, out of the family, it peppers up; but not exactly,
you understand, and that&rsquo;s the way it is.&nbsp; And I remember a case
in point, and that was one day, and I had sold a horse, and was with my boy
in a <i>moramengro&rsquo;s buddika</i> [barber&rsquo;s shop], and my boy
says to me, in Romanes, &lsquo;Father, I&rsquo;d like to have my hair
cut.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s too dear here, my son,&rsquo; said I,
Romaneskes; &lsquo;for the bill says threepence.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then the
barber, he ups and says, in Romany, &lsquo;Since you&rsquo;re Romanys,
I&rsquo;ll cut it for <i>two</i>pence, though it&rsquo;s clear out of all
my rules.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he did <!-- page 124--><a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>it; but why that man
<i>rakkered Romanes</i> I don&rsquo;t know, nor how it comes about; for he
hadn&rsquo;t no more call to it than a pig has to be a preacher.&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;ve known men in Sussex to take to diggin&rsquo; truffles on the
same principles, and one Gorgio in Hastings that adopted sellin&rsquo;
fried fish for his livin&rsquo;, about the town, because he thought it was
kind of romantic.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over the chimney-piece hung a large engraving of Milton and his
daughters.&nbsp; It was out of place, and our host knew it, and was
proud.&nbsp; He said he had bought it at an auction, and that it was a
picture of Middleton,&mdash;a poet, he believed; &ldquo;anyhow, he was a
writing man.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, on second thought, he remembered that the
name was not Middleton, but Millerton.&nbsp; And on further reflection, he
was still more convinced that Millerton <i>was</i> a poet.</p>
<p>I once asked old Matthew Cooper the Romany word for a poet.&nbsp; And he
promptly replied that he had generally heard such a man called a
<i>givellengero</i> or <i>gilliengro</i>, which means a song-master, but
that he himself regarded <i>shereskero-mush</i>, or head-man, as more
elegant and deeper; for poets make songs out of their heads, and are also
ahead of all other men in head-work.&nbsp; There is a touching and
unconscious tribute to the art of arts in this definition which is worth
recording.&nbsp; It has been said that, as people grow polite, they cease
to be poetical; it is certain that in the first circles they do not speak
of their poets with such respect as this.</p>
<p>Out again into the fresh air and the frost on the crisp, crackling road
and in the sunshine.&nbsp; At such a time, when cold inspires life, one can
understand why the old poets and mystics believed that there was fire <!--
page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>in
ice.&nbsp; Therefore, Saint Sebaldus, coming into the hut of a poor and
pious man who was dying of cold, went out, and, bringing in an armful of
icicles, laid them on the andirons and made a good fire.&nbsp; Now this
fire was the inner glowing glory of God, and worked both ways,&mdash;of
course you see the connection,&mdash;as was shown in Adelheid von
Sigolsheim, the Holy Nun of Unterlinden, who was so full of it that she
passed the night in a freezing stream, and then stood all the morning,
ice-clad, in the choir, and never caught cold.&nbsp; And the pious
Peroneta, to avoid a sinful suitor, lived all winter, up to her neck, in
ice-water, on the highest Alp in Savoy. <a name="citation125"></a><a
href="#footnote125" class="citation">[125]</a>&nbsp; These were
saints.&nbsp; But there was a gypsy, named Dighton, encamped near Brighton,
who told me nearly the same story of another gypsy, who was no saint, and
which I repeat merely to show how extremes meet.&nbsp; It was that this
gypsy, who was inspired with anything but the inner glowing glory of God,
but who was, on the contrary, cram full of pure cussedness, being warmed by
the same,&mdash;and the devil,&mdash;when chased by the constable, took
refuge in a river full of freezing slush and broken ice, where he stood up
to his neck and defied capture; for he verily cared no more for it than did
Saint Peter of Alcantara, who was both ice and fire proof.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come out of that, my good man,&rdquo; said the gentleman, whose hen
he had stolen, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll let you go.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, I
won&rsquo;t come out,&rdquo; said the gypsy.&nbsp; &ldquo;My blood be on
your head!&rdquo;&nbsp; So the gentleman offered him five pounds, and then
a suit of clothes, to come ashore.&nbsp; The gypsy reflected, and at last
said, &ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;ll add a drink of spirits, I&rsquo;ll come;
but it&rsquo;s only to oblige you that I budge.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>Then we walked in the sober evening, with its gray gathering
shadows, as the last western rose light rippled in the river, yet fading in
the sky,&mdash;like a good man who, in dying, speaks cheerfully of earthly
things, while his soul is vanishing serenely into heaven.&nbsp; The swans,
looking like snowballs, unconscious of cold were taking their last swim
towards the reedy, brake-tangled islets where they nested, gossiping as
they went.&nbsp; The deepening darkness, at such a time, becomes more
impressive from the twinkling stars, just as the subduing silence is noted
only by the far-borne sounds from the hamlet or farm-house, or the
occasional whispers of the night-breeze.&nbsp; So we went on in the
twilight, along the Thames, till we saw the night-fire of the Romanys and
its gleam on the <i>tan</i>.&nbsp; A <i>tan</i> is, strictly speaking, a
tent, but a tent is a dwelling, or stopping-place; and so from earliest
Aryan time, the word <i>tan</i> is like Alabama, or &ldquo;here we
rest,&rdquo; and may be found in <i>tun</i>, the ancestor of town, and in
<i>stan</i>, as in Hindostan,&mdash;and if I blunder, so much the better
for the philological gentlemen, who, of all others, most delight in setting
erring brothers right, and never miss a chance to show, through
others&rsquo; shame, how much they know.</p>
<p>There was a bark of a dog, and a voice said, &ldquo;The Romany
rye!&rdquo;&nbsp; They had not seen us, but the dog knew, and they knew his
language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sarishan ryor</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>O boro duvel atch&rsquo; pa leste</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; (The great
Lord be on you!)&nbsp; This is not a common Romany greeting.&nbsp; It is of
ancient days and archaic.&nbsp; Sixty or seventy years ago it was
current.&nbsp; Old Gentilla Cooper, the famous fortune-teller of the
Devil&rsquo;s Dike, near Brighton, knew it, and when she heard it from me
she <!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>was moved,&mdash;just as a very old negro in London was, when I
said to him, &ldquo;<i>Sady</i>, uncle.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said it because I
had recognized by the dog&rsquo;s bark that it was Sam Smith&rsquo;s
tan.&nbsp; Sam likes to be considered as <i>deep</i> Romany.&nbsp; He tries
to learn old gypsy words, and he affects old gypsy ways.&nbsp; He is
pleased to be called Petulengro, which means Smith.&nbsp; Therefore, my
greeting was a compliment.</p>
<p>In a few minutes we were in camp and at home.&nbsp; We talked of many
things, and among others of witches.&nbsp; It is remarkable that while the
current English idea of a witch is that of an old woman who has sold
herself to Satan, and is a distinctly marked character, just like Satan
himself, that of the witch among gypsies is general and Oriental.&nbsp;
There is no Satan in India.&nbsp; Mrs. Smith&mdash;since dead&mdash;held
that witches were to be found everywhere.&nbsp; &ldquo;You may know a
natural witch,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;by certain signs.&nbsp; One of these
is straight hair which curls at the ends.&nbsp; Such women have it in
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was only recently, as I write, that I was at a very elegant art
reception, which was fully reported in the newspapers.&nbsp; And I was very
much astonished when a lady called my attention to another young and very
pretty lady, and expressed intense disgust at the way the latter wore her
hair.&nbsp; It was simply parted in the middle, and fell down on either
side, smooth as a water-fall, and then broke into curls at the ends, just
as water, after falling, breaks into waves and rapids.&nbsp; But as she
spoke, I felt it all, and saw that Mrs. Petulengro was in the right.&nbsp;
The girl with the end-curled hair was uncanny.&nbsp; Her hair curled at the
ends,&mdash;so did her eyes; she <i>was</i> a witch.</p>
<p><!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s a many witches as knows clever
things,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I learned from one of
them how to cure the rheumatiz.&nbsp; Suppose you&rsquo;ve got the
rheumatiz.&nbsp; Well, just you carry a potato in your pocket.&nbsp; As the
potato dries up, your rheumatiz will go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam Smith was always known on the roads as Fighting Sam.&nbsp; Years
have passed, and when I have asked after him I have always heard that he
was either in prison or had just been let out.&nbsp; Once it happened that,
during a fight with a Gorgio, the Gorgio&rsquo;s watch disappeared, and Sam
was arrested under suspicion of having got up the fight in order that the
watch might disappear.&nbsp; All of his friends declared his
innocence.&nbsp; The next trouble was for <i>chorin a gry</i>, or stealing
a horse, and so was the next, and so on.&nbsp; As horse-stealing is not a
crime, but only &ldquo;rough gambling,&rdquo; on the roads, nobody defended
him on these counts.&nbsp; He was, so far as this went, only a sporting
character.&nbsp; When his wife died he married Athal&iacute;a, the widow of
Joshua Cooper, a gypsy, of whom I shall speak anon.&nbsp; I always liked
Sam.&nbsp; Among the travelers, he was always spoken of as genteel, owing
to the fact, that whatever the state of his wardrobe might be, he always
wore about his neck an immaculate white woolen scarf, and on <i>jours de
f&ecirc;te</i>, such as horse-races, sported a <i>boro stard&#299;</i>, or
chimney-pot hat.&nbsp; O my friend, Colonel Dash, of the club!&nbsp; Change
but the name, this fable is of thee!</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s to be a <i>walgoro</i>, <i>kaliko i
sala</i>&mdash;a fair to-morrow morning, at Cobham,&rdquo; said Sam, as he
departed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>As I went forth by the river into the night, and the stars looked
down like loving eyes, there shot a meteor across the sky, one long trail
of light, out of darkness into darkness, one instant bright, then dead
forever.&nbsp; And I remembered how I once was told that stars, like
mortals, often fall in love.&nbsp; O love, forever in thy glory go!&nbsp;
And that they send their starry angels forth, and that the meteors are
their messengers.&nbsp; O love, forever in thy glory go!&nbsp; For love and
light in heaven, as on earth, were ever one, and planets speak with
light.&nbsp; Light is their language; as they love they speak.&nbsp; O
love, forever in thy glory go!</p>

130</span>III.&nbsp; COBHAM FAIR.</h3>
<p>The walk from Oatlands Park Hotel to Cobham is beautiful with memorials
of Older England.&nbsp; Even on the grounds there is a quaint brick
gateway, which is the only relic of a palace which preceded the present
pile.&nbsp; The grandfather was indeed a stately edifice, built by Henry
VIII., improved and magnified, according to his lights, by Inigo Jones, and
then destroyed during the civil war.&nbsp; The river is here very
beautiful, and the view was once painted by Turner.&nbsp; It abounds in
&ldquo;short windings and reaches.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here it is, indeed, the
Olerifera Thamesis, as it was called by Guillaume le Breton in his
&ldquo;Phillipeis,&rdquo; in the days of Richard the Lion Heart.&nbsp; Here
the eyots and banks still recall Norman days, for they are &ldquo;wild and
were;&rdquo; and there is even yet a wary otter or two, known to the
gypsies and fishermen, which may be seen of moonlight nights plunging or
swimming silently in the haunted water.</p>
<p>Now we pass Walton Church, and look in, that my friend may see the massy
Norman pillars and arches, the fine painted glass, and the brasses.&nbsp;
One of these represents John Selwyn, who was keeper of the royal park of
Oatlands in 1587.&nbsp; Tradition, still current in the village, says that
Selwyn was a man of wondrous strength and of rare skill in
horsemanship.&nbsp; <!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>Once, when Queen Elizabeth was present at a
stag hunt, he leaped from his horse upon the back of the stag, while both
were running at full speed, kept his seat gracefully, guided the animal
towards the queen, and stabbed him so deftly that he fell dead at her
majesty&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp; It was daintily done, and doubtless Queen Bess,
who loved a proper man, was well pleased.&nbsp; The brass plate represents
Selwyn as riding on the stag, and there is in the village a shop where the
neat old dame who presides, or her daughter, will sell you for a penny a
picture of the plate, and tell you the story into the bargain.&nbsp; In it
the valiant ranger sits on the stag, which he is stabbing through the neck
with his <i>couteau de chasse</i>, looking meanwhile as solemn as if he
were sitting in a pew and listening to <i>De profundis</i>.&nbsp; He who is
great in one respect seldom fails in some other, and there is in the church
another and a larger brass, from which it appears that Selwyn not only had
a wife, but also eleven children, who are depicted in successive grandeur
or gradation.&nbsp; There are monuments by Roubiliac and Chantrey in the
church, and on the left side of the altar lies buried William Lilly, the
great astrologer, the Sidrophel of Butler&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Hudibras.&rdquo;&nbsp; And look into the chancel.&nbsp; There is a
tablet to his memory, which was put up by Elias Ashmole, the antiquary, who
has left it in print that this &ldquo;fair black marble stone&rdquo; cost
him &pound;6 4<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.&nbsp; When I was a youth, and used to
pore in the old Franklin Library of Philadelphia over Lilly, I never
thought that his grave would be so near my home.&nbsp; But a far greater
literary favorite of mine lies buried in the church-yard without.&nbsp;
This is Dr. Maginn, the author of &ldquo;Father Tom and the Pope,&rdquo;
and many <!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>another racy, subtle jest.&nbsp; A fellow of infinite
humor,&mdash;the truest disciple of Rabelais,&mdash;and here he lies
without a monument!</p>
<p>Summon the sexton, and let us ask him to show us the scold&rsquo;s, or
gossip&rsquo;s, bridle.&nbsp; This is a rare curiosity, which is kept in
the vestry.&nbsp; It would seem, from all that can be learned, that two
hundred years ago there were in England viragoes so virulent, women so
gifted with gab and so loaded and primed with the devil&rsquo;s own
gunpowder, that all moral suasion was wasted on them, and simply showed, as
old Reisersberg wrote, that <i>fatue agit qui ignem conatur extinguere
sulphure</i> (&rsquo;t is all nonsense to try to quench fire with
brimstone).&nbsp; For such diavolas they had made&mdash;what the sexton is
just going to show you&mdash;a muzzle of thin iron bars, which pass around
the head and are padlocked behind.&nbsp; In front a flat piece of iron
enters the mouth and keeps down the tongue.&nbsp; On it is the date 1633,
and certain lines, no longer legible:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Chester presents Walton with a bridle,<br />
To curb women&rsquo;s tongues that talk too idle.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A sad story, if we only knew it all!&nbsp; What tradition tells is that
long ago there was a Master Chester, who lost a fine estate through the
idle, malicious clack of a gossiping, lying woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is
good for a bootless bene?&rdquo;&nbsp; What he did was to endow the church
with this admirable piece of head-gear.&nbsp; And when any woman in the
parish was unanimously adjudged to be deserving of the honor, the bridle
was put on her head and tongue, and she was led about town by the beadle as
an example to all the scolding sisterhood.&nbsp; Truly, if it could only be
applied to the women and men who repeat gossip, rumors <!-- page 133--><a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>reports, <i>on
dits</i>, small slanders, proved or unproved, to all gobe-mouches,
club-gabblers, tea-talkers and tattlers, chatterers, church-twaddlers,
wonderers if-it-be-true-what-they-say; in fine, to the entire sister and
brother hood of tongue-waggers, I for one would subscribe my mite to have
one kept in every church in the world, to be zealously applied to their
vile jaws.&nbsp; For verily the mere Social Evil is an angel of light on
this earth as regards doing evil, compared to the Sociable Evil,&mdash;and
thus endeth the first lesson.</p>
<p>We leave the church, so full of friendly memories.&nbsp; In this one
building alone there are twenty things known to me from a boy.&nbsp; For
from boyhood I have held in my memory those lines by Queen Elizabeth which
she uttered here, and have read Lilly and Ashmole and Maginn; and this is
only one corner in merrie England!&nbsp; Am I a stranger here?&nbsp; There
is a father-land of the soul, which has no limits to him who, far sweeping
on the wings of song and history, goes forth over many lands.</p>
<p>We have but a little farther to go on our way before we come to the
quaint old manor-house which was of old the home of President Bradshaw, the
grim old Puritan.&nbsp; There is an old sailor in the village, who owns a
tavern, and he says, and the policeman agrees with him, that it was in this
house that the death-warrant of King Charles the First was signed.&nbsp;
Also, that there is a subterranean passage which leads from it to the
Thames, which was in some way connected with battle, murder, plots,
Puritans, sudden death, and politics; though how this was is more than
legend can clearly explain.&nbsp; Whether his sacred majesty was led to
execution through this <!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>cavity, or whether Charles the Second had it
for one of his numerous hiding-places, or returned through it with Nell
Gwynn from his exile, are other obscure points debated among the
villagers.&nbsp; The truth is that the whole country about Walton is
subterrened with strange and winding ways, leading no one knows whither,
dug in the days of the monks or knights, from one long-vanished monastery
or castle to the other.&nbsp; There is the opening to one of these hard by
the hotel, but there was never any gold found in it that ever I heard
of.&nbsp; And all the land is full of legend, and ghosts glide o&rsquo;
nights along the alleys, and there is an infallible fairy well at hand,
named the Nun, and within a short walk stands the tremendous Crouch oak,
which was known of Saxon days.&nbsp; Whoever gives but a little of its bark
to a lady will win her love.&nbsp; It takes its name from <i>croix</i> (a
cross), according to Mr. Kemble, <a name="citation134"></a><a
href="#footnote134" class="citation">[134]</a> and it is twenty-four feet
in girth.&nbsp; Its first branch, which is forty-eight feet long, shoots
out horizontally, and is almost as large as the trunk.&nbsp; Under this
tree Wickliffe preached, and Queen Elizabeth dined.</p>
<p>It has been well said by Irving that the English, from the great
prevalence of rural habits throughout every class of society, have been
extremely fond of those festivals and holidays which agreeably interrupt
the stillness of country life.&nbsp; True, the days have gone when
burlesque pageant and splendid procession made even villages
magnificent.&nbsp; Harp and tabor and viol are no longer heard in every inn
when people would be merry, and men have forgotten how to give themselves
up to headlong roaring revelry.&nbsp; The last of this tremendous
frolicking in Europe <!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>died out with the last yearly <i>kermess</i>
in Amsterdam, and it was indeed wonderful to see with what utter
<i>abandon</i> the usually stolid Dutch flung themselves into a rushing
tide of frantic gayety.&nbsp; Here and there in England a spark of the old
fire, lit in medi&aelig;val times, still flickers, or perhaps flames, as at
Dorking in the annual foot-ball play, which is carried on with such vigor
that two or three thousand people run wild in it, while all the windows and
street lamps are carefully screened for protection.&nbsp; But
notwithstanding the gradually advancing republicanism of the age, which is
dressing all men alike, bodily and mentally, the rollicking democracy of
these old-fashioned festivals, in which the peasant bonneted the peer
without ceremony, and rustic maids ran races <i>en chemise</i> for a pound
of tea, is entirely too leveling for culture.&nbsp; There are still,
however, numbers of village fairs, quietly conducted, in which there is
much that is pleasant and picturesque, and this at Cobham was as pretty a
bit of its kind as I ever saw.&nbsp; These are old-fashioned and gay in
their little retired nooks, and there the plain people show themselves as
they really are.&nbsp; The better class of the neighborhood, having no
sympathy with such sports or scenes, do not visit village fairs.&nbsp; It
is, indeed, a most exceptional thing to see any man who is a
&ldquo;gentleman,&rdquo; according to the society standard, in any fair
except Mayfair in London.</p>
<p>Cobham is well built for dramatic display.&nbsp; Its White Lion Inn is
of the old coaching days, and the lion on its front is a very impressive
monster, one of the few relics of the days when signs were signs in spirit
and in truth.&nbsp; In this respect the tavern keeper of to-day is a poor
snob, that he thinks a sign painted <!-- page 136--><a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>or carven is
degenerate and low, and therefore announces, in a line of letters, that his
establishment is the Pig and Whistle, just as his remote predecessor
thought it was low, or slow, or old-fashioned to dedicate his ale-shop to
Pigen Wassail or Hail to the Virgin, and so changed it to a more genteel
and secular form.&nbsp; In the public place were rows of booths arranged in
streets forming <i>imperium in imperio</i>, a town within a town.&nbsp;
There was of course the traditional gilt gingerbread, and the cheering but
not inebriating ginger-beer, dear to the youthful palate, and not less
loved by the tired pedestrian, when, mixed half and half with ale, it foams
before him as <i>shandy gaff</i>.&nbsp; There, too, were the stands,
presided over by jaunty, saucy girls, who would load a rifle for you and
give you a prize or a certain number of shots for a shilling.&nbsp; You may
be a good shot, but the better you shoot the less likely will you be to hit
the bull&rsquo;s-eye with the rifle which that black-eyed Egyptian minx
gives you; for it is artfully curved and false-sighted, and the rifle was
made only to rifle your pocket, and the damsel to sell you with her smiles,
and the doll is stuffed with sawdust, and life is not worth living for, and
Miching Mallocko says it,&mdash;albeit I believe he lives at times as if
there might be moments when it was forgot.</p>
<p>And we had not been long on the ground before we were addressed
furtively and gravely by a man whom it required a second glance to
recognize as Samuel Petulengro, so artfully was he disguised as a
simple-seeming agriculturalist of the better lower-class.&nbsp; But that
there remained in Sam&rsquo;s black eyes that glint of the Romany which
nothing could disguise, one would have longed to buy a horse of him.&nbsp;
<!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>And in the same quiet way there came, one by one, out of the
crowd, six others, all speaking in subdued voices, like conspirators, and
in Romany, as if it were a sin.&nbsp; And all were dressed rustically, and
the same with intent to deceive, and all had the solemn air of very small
farmers, who must sell that horse at any sacrifice.&nbsp; But when I saw
Sam&rsquo;s horses I marked that his disguise of himself was nothing to the
wondrous skill with which he had converted his five-pound screws into
something comparatively elegant.&nbsp; They had been curried, clipped,
singed, and beautified to the last resource, and the manner in which the
finest straw had been braided into mane and tail was a miracle of
art.&nbsp; This was <i>jour de f&ecirc;te</i> for Sam and his
<i>diddikai</i>, or half-blood pals; his foot was on his native heath in
the horse-fair, where all inside the ring knew the gypsy, and it was with
pride that he invited us to drink ale, and once in the bar-room, where all
assembled were jockeys and sharps, conversed loudly in Romany, in order to
exhibit himself and us to admiring friends.&nbsp; A Romany rye, on such
occasions, is to a Sam Petulengro what a scion of royalty is to minor
aristocracy when it can lure him into its nets.&nbsp; To watch one of these
small horse-dealers at a fair, and to observe the manner in which he
conducts his bargains, is very curious.&nbsp; He lounges about all day,
apparently doing nothing; he is the only idler around.&nbsp; Once in a
while somebody approaches him and mutters something, to which he gives a
brief reply.&nbsp; Then he goes to a tap-room or stable-yard, and is merged
in a mob of his mates.&nbsp; But all the while he is doing sharp clicks of
business.&nbsp; There is somebody talking to another party about <i>that
horse</i>; somebody telling a farmer that he knows <!-- page 138--><a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>a young man as has
got a likely &rsquo;oss at &rsquo;arf price, the larst of a lot which he
wants to clear out, and it may be &rsquo;ad, but if the young man sees
&rsquo;im [the farmer] he may put it on &rsquo;eavy.</p>
<p>Then the agent calls in one of the disguised Romanys to testify to the
good qualities of the horse.&nbsp; They look at it, but the third
<i>deguis&eacute;</i>, who has it in charge, avers that it has just been
sold to a gentleman.&nbsp; But they have another.&nbsp; By this time the
farmer wishes he had bought the horse.&nbsp; When any coin slips from
between our fingers, and rolls down through a grating into the sewer, we
are always sure that it was a sovereign, and not a half-penny.&nbsp; Yes,
and the fish which drops back from the line into the river is always the
biggest take&mdash;or mistake&mdash;of the day.&nbsp; And this horse was a
bargain, and the three in disguise say so, and wish they had a hundred like
it.&nbsp; But there comes a Voice from the depths, a casual remark,
offering to bet that &rsquo;ere gent won&rsquo;t close on that hoss.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Bet yer ten bob he will.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Done.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;How do yer know he don&rsquo;t take the hoss?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He
carn&rsquo;t; he&rsquo;s too heavy loaded with Bill&rsquo;s mare.&nbsp;
Says he&rsquo;ll sell it for a pound better.&rdquo;&nbsp; The farmer begins
to see his way.&nbsp; He is shrewd; it may be that he sees through all this
myth of &ldquo;the gentleman.&rdquo;&nbsp; But his attention has been
attracted to the horse.&nbsp; Perhaps he pays a little more, or &ldquo;the
pound better;&rdquo; in greater probability he gets Sam&rsquo;s horse for
the original price.&nbsp; There are many ways among gypsies of making such
bargains, but the motive power of them all is <i>t&aacute;derin</i>, or
drawing the eye of the purchaser, a game not unknown to Gorgios.&nbsp; I
have heard of a German <i>yah&#363;d</i> in Philadelphia, whose little boy
Moses would shoot from the door <!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>with a pop-gun or squirt at passers-by, or
abuse them vilely, and then run into the shop for shelter.&nbsp; They of
course pursued him and complained to the parent, who immediately whipped
his son, to the great solace of the afflicted ones.&nbsp; And then the
afflicted seldom failed to buy something in that shop, and the corrected
son received ten per cent. of the profit.&nbsp; The attention of the public
had been drawn.</p>
<p>As we went about looking at people and pastimes, a Romany, I think one
of the Ayres, said to me,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See the two policemen?&nbsp; They&rsquo;re following you two
gentlemen.&nbsp; They saw you pallin&rsquo; with Bowers.&nbsp; That Bowers
is the biggest blackguard on the roads between London and Windsor.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t want to hurt his char&aacute;ckter, but it&rsquo;s no bad
talkin&rsquo; nor <i>dusherin</i> of him to say that no decent Romanys care
to go with him.&nbsp; Good at a mill?&nbsp; Yes, he&rsquo;s that.&nbsp; A
reg&rsquo;lar <i>wastimengro</i>, I call him.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s why it
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now there was in the fair a vast institution which proclaimed by a
monstrous sign and by an excessive eruption of advertisement that it was
<span class="smcap">The Sensation of the Age</span>.&nbsp; This was a giant
hand-organ in connection with a forty-bicycle merry-go-round, all propelled
by steam.&nbsp; And as we walked about the fair, the two rural policemen,
who had nothing better to do, shadowed or followed us, their bucolic
features expressing the intensest suspicion allied to the extremest
stupidity; when suddenly the Sensation of the Age struck up the
Gendarme&rsquo;s chorus, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll run &rsquo;em in,&rdquo; from
Genevieve de Brabant, and the arrangement was complete.&nbsp; Of all airs
ever composed this was the most appropriate to the occasion, and therefore
it played itself.&nbsp; The whole formed quite a little opera-bouffe,
gypsies not being wanting.&nbsp; <!-- page 140--><a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>And as we came round,
in our promenade, the pretty girl, with her rifle in hand, implored us to
take a shot, and the walk wound up by her finally letting fly herself and
ringing the bell.</p>
<p>That pretty girl might or might not have a touch of Romany blood in her
veins, but it is worth noting that among all these show-men and show-women,
acrobats, exhibitors of giants, purse-droppers, gingerbread-wheel gamblers,
shilling knife-throwers, pitch-in-his-mouths, Punches, Cheap-Jacks,
thimble-rigs, and patterers of every kind there is always a leaven and a
suspicion of gypsiness.&nbsp; If there be not descent, there is affinity by
marriage, familiarity, knowledge of words and ways, sweethearting and
trafficking, so that they know the children of the Rom as the house-world
does not know them, and they in some sort belong together.&nbsp; It is a
muddle, perhaps, and a puzzle; I doubt if anybody quite understands
it.&nbsp; No novelist, no writer whatever, has as yet <i>clearly</i>
explained the curious fact that our entire nomadic population, excepting
tramps, is not, as we thought in our childhood, composed of English people
like ourselves.&nbsp; It is leavened with direct Indian blood; it has, more
or less modified, a peculiar <i>morale</i>.&nbsp; It was old before the
Saxon heptarchy.</p>
<p>I was very much impressed at this fair with the extensive and
unsuspected amount of Romany existent in our rural population.&nbsp; We had
to be satisfied, as we came late into the tavern for lunch, with cold
boiled beef and carrots, of which I did not complain, as cold carrots are
much nicer than warm, a fact too little understood in cookery.&nbsp; There
were many men in the common room, mostly well dressed, and decent even if
doubtful looking.&nbsp; I observed <!-- page 141--><a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>that several used
Romany words in casual conversation.&nbsp; I came to the conclusion at last
that all who were present knew something of it.&nbsp; The greatly
reprobated Bowers was not himself a gypsy, but he had a gypsy wife.&nbsp;
He lived in a cottage not far from Walton, and made baskets, while his wife
roamed far and near, selling them; and I have more than once stopped and
sent for a pot of ale, and shared it with Bill, listening meantime to his
memories of the road as he caned chairs or &ldquo;basketed.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
think his reputation came rather from a certain Bohemian disregard of
<i>convenances</i> and of appearances than from any deeply-seated
sinfulness.&nbsp; For there are Bohemians even among gypsies; everything in
this life being relative and socially-contractive.&nbsp; When I came to
know the disreputable William well, I found in him the principles of
Panurge, deeply identified with the <i>morale</i> of Falstaff; a wondrous
fund of unbundled humor, which expressed itself more by tones than words; a
wisdom based on the practices of the prize-ring; and a perfectly
sympathetic admiration of my researches into Romany.&nbsp; One day, at
Kingston Fair, as I wished to depart, I asked Bill the way to the
station.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will go with you and show you,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; But knowing that he had business in the fair I declined his
escort.&nbsp; He looked at me as if hurt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Does tute pen mandy&rsquo;d chore tute</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; (Do
you think I would rob <i>you</i> or pick your pockets?)&nbsp; For he
believed I was afraid of it.&nbsp; I knew Bill better.&nbsp; I knew that he
was perfectly aware that I was about the only man in England who had a good
opinion of him in any way, or knew what good there was in him.&nbsp; When a
<i>femme incomprise</i>, a woman not as yet found out, discovers at last
the man who is so <!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>much a master of the art of flattery as to
satisfy somewhat her inordinate vanity, she is generally grateful enough to
him who has thus gratified her desires to refrain from speaking ill of him,
and abuse those who do, especially the latter.&nbsp; In like manner, Bill
Bowers, who was every whit as interesting as any <i>femme incomprise</i> in
Belgravia, or even Russell Square, believing that I had a little better
opinion of him than anybody else, would not only have refrained from
robbing me, but have proceeded to lam with his fists anybody else who would
have done so,&mdash;the latter proceeding being, from his point of view,
only a light, cheerful, healthy, and invigorating exercise, so that, as he
said, and as I believe truthfully, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather be walloped than
not fight.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even as my friend H. had rather lose than not play
&ldquo;farrer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a very pretty little country fair at Cobham; pleasant and
purely English.&nbsp; It was very picturesque, with its flags, banners,
gayly bedecked booths, and mammoth placards, there being, as usual, no lack
of color or objects.&nbsp; I wonder that Mr. Frith, who has given with such
idiomatic genius the humors of the Derby, has never painted an
old-fashioned rural fair like this.&nbsp; In a few years the last of them
will have been closed, and the last gypsy will be there to look on.</p>
<p>There was a pleasant sight in the afternoon, when all at once, as it
seemed to me, there came hundreds of pretty, rosy-cheeked children into the
fair.&nbsp; There were twice as many of them as of grown people.&nbsp; I
think that, the schools being over for the day, they had been sent
a-fairing for a treat.&nbsp; They swarmed in like small bee-angels, just
escaped from some upset celestial hive; they crowded around the booths,
buying <!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>little toys, chattering, bargaining, and laughing, when my eye
caught theirs, as though to be noticed was the very best joke in the whole
world.&nbsp; They soon found out the Sensation of the Age, and the mammoth
steam bicycle was forthwith crowded with the happy little creatures,
raptured in all the glory of a ride.&nbsp; The cars looked like baskets
full of roses.&nbsp; It was delightful to see them: at first like grave and
stolid little Anglo-Saxons, occupied seriously with the new Sensation; then
here and there beaming with thawing jollity; then smiling like sudden
sun-gleams; and then laughing, until all were in one grand chorus, as the
speed became greater, and the organ roared out its notes as rapidly as a
runaway musical locomotive, and the steam-engine puffed in time, until a
high-pressure scream told that the penn&rsquo;orth of fun was up.</p>
<p>As we went home in the twilight, and looked back at the trees and roofs
of the village, in dark silhouette against the gold-bronze sky, and heard
from afar and fitfully the music of the Great Sensation mingled with the
beat of a drum and the shouts of the crowd, rising and falling with the
wind, I felt a little sad, that the age, in its advancing refinement, is
setting itself against these old-fashioned merry-makings, and shrinking
like a weakling from all out-of-doors festivals, on the plea of their being
disorderly, but in reality because they are believed to be vulgar.&nbsp;
They come down to us from rough old days; but they are relics of a time
when life, if rough, was at least kind and hearty.&nbsp; We admire that
life on the stage, we ape it in novels, we affect admiration and
appreciation of its rich picturesqueness and vigorous originality, and we
lie in so doing; for there is not an &aelig;sthetic prig <!-- page 144--><a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>in London who could
have lived an hour in it.&nbsp; Truly, I should like to know what
Fran&ccedil;ois Villon and Chaucer would have thought of some of their
modern adorers, or what the lioness Fair-sinners of the olden time would
have had to say to the nervous weaklings who try to play the genial
blackguard in their praise!&nbsp; It is to me the best joke of the age that
those who now set themselves up for priests of the old faith are the men,
of all others, whom the old gods would have kicked, <i>cum magna
injuria</i>, out of the temple.&nbsp; When I sit by Bill Bowers, as he
baskets, and hear the bees buzz about his marigolds, or in Plato
Buckland&rsquo;s van, or with a few hearty and true men of London town of
whom I wot, <i>then</i> I know that the old spirit liveth in its ashes; but
there is little of it, I trow, among its penny prig-trumpeters.</p>

145</span>IV.&nbsp; THE MIXED FORTUNES.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Thus spoke the king to the great Master: &lsquo;Thou didst bless
and ban the people; thou didst give benison and curse, luck and sorrow, to
the evil or the good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Master said, &lsquo;It may be so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the king continued, &lsquo;There came two men, and one was
good and the other bad.&nbsp; And one thou didst bless, thinking he was
good; but he was wicked.&nbsp; And the other thou didst curse, and thought
him bad; but he was good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Master said, &lsquo;And what came of it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The king answered, &lsquo;All evil came upon the good man, and
all happiness to the bad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Master said, &lsquo;I write letters, but I am not the
messenger; I hunt the deer, but I am not the cook; I plant the vine, but I
do not pour the wine to the guests; I ordain war, yet do not fight; I send
ships forth on the sea, but do not sail them.&nbsp; There is many a slip
between cup and lip, as the chief of the rebel spirits said when he was
thrown out of heaven, and I am not greater nor wiser than he was before he
fell.&nbsp; Hast thou any more questions, O son?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the king went his way.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One afternoon I was walking with three ladies.&nbsp; One was married,
one was a young widow, and one, no longer very young, had not as yet
husbanded her resources.&nbsp; And as we went by the Thames, conversation
turned upon many things, and among them the mystery of the future and
mediums; and the widow at last said she would like to have her fortune
told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not go far to have it done,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is a gypsy camp not a mile away, and in it one of the
cleverest fortune-tellers in England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am almost afraid to go,&rdquo; said the maiden lady.&nbsp; <!--
page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>&ldquo;It seems to me to be really wrong to try to look into the
awful secrets of futurity.&nbsp; One can never be certain as to what a
gypsy may not know.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all very well, I dare say, to declare
it&rsquo;s all rubbish, but then you know you never can tell what may be in
a rubbish-heap, and they may be predicting true things all the time while
they think they&rsquo;re humbugging you.&nbsp; And they do often foretell
the most wonderful things; I know they do.&nbsp; My aunt was told that she
would marry a man who would cause her trouble, and, sure enough, she did;
and it was such a shame, she was such a sweet-tempered, timid woman, and he
spent half her immense fortune.&nbsp; Now wasn&rsquo;t that
wonderful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would be a curious matter for those who like studying statistics and
chance to find out what proportion in England of sweet-tempered, timid
women of the medium-middle class, in newly-sprouted families, with immense
fortunes, do <i>not</i> marry men who only want their money.&nbsp; Such
heiresses are the natural food of the noble shark and the swell sucker, and
even a gypsy knows it, and can read them at a glance.&nbsp; I explained
this to the lady; but she knew what she knew, and would not know
otherwise.</p>
<p>So we came along the rippling river, watching the darting swallows and
light water-gnats, as the sun sank afar into the tawny, golden west, and
Night, in ever-nearing circles, wove her shades around us.&nbsp; We saw the
little tents, like bee-hives,&mdash;one, indeed, not larger than the hive
in which Tyll Eulenspiegel slept his famous nap, and in which he was
carried away by the thieves who mistook him for honey and found him
vinegar.&nbsp; And the outposts, or advanced pickets of small, brown,
black-eyed elves, were tumbling about <!-- page 147--><a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>as usual, and shouted
their glad greeting; for it was only the day before that I had come down
with two dozen oranges, which by chance proved to be just one apiece for
all to eat except for little Synfie Cooper, who saved hers up for her
father when he should return.</p>
<p>I had just an instant in which to give the gypsy sorceress a
&ldquo;straight tip,&rdquo; and this I did, saying in Romany that one of
the ladies was married and one a widow.&nbsp; I was indeed quite sure that
she must know the married lady as such, since she had lived near at hand,
within a mile, for months.&nbsp; And so, with all due solemnity, the
sorceress went to her work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will come first, my lady, if you please,&rdquo; she said to
the married dame, and led her into a hedge-corner, so as to be remote from
public view, while we waited by the camp.</p>
<p>The hand was inspected, and properly crossed with a shilling, and the
seeress began her prediction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful hand, my lady, and there&rsquo;s luck in
it.&nbsp; The line o&rsquo; life runs lovely and clear, just like a smooth
river from sea to sea, and that means you&rsquo;ll never be in danger
before you die, nor troubled with much ill.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s written
that you&rsquo;ll have another husband very soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want another,&rdquo; said the lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear lady, so you&rsquo;ll say till you get him, but when
he comes you&rsquo;ll be glad enough; so do you just get the first one out
of your head as soon as you can, for the next will be the better one.&nbsp;
And you&rsquo;ll cross the sea and travel in a foreign land, and remember
what I told you to the end of your life days.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>Then the widow had her turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a lucky hand, and little need you had to have your
fortune told.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve been well married once, and once is enough
when it&rsquo;s all you need.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s others as is never
satisfied and wants everything, but you&rsquo;ve had the best, and more you
needn&rsquo;t want, though there&rsquo;ll be many a man who&rsquo;ll be in
love with you.&nbsp; Ay, indeed, there&rsquo;s fair and dark as will feel
the favor of your beautiful eyes, but little good will it do them, and
barons and lords as would kiss the ground you tread on; and no wonder,
either, for you have the charm which nobody can tell what it is.&nbsp; But
it will do &rsquo;em no good, nevermore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m never to have another husband,&rdquo; said the
widow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my lady.&nbsp; He that you married was the best of all, and,
after him, you&rsquo;ll never need another; and that was written in your
hand when you were born, and it will be your fate, forever and ever: and
that is the gypsy&rsquo;s production over the future, and what she has
producted will come true.&nbsp; All the stars in the fermentation of heaven
can&rsquo;t change it.&nbsp; But if you ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t satisfied, I can
set a planet for you, and try the cards, which comes more expensive, for I
never do that under ten shillings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a comparing of notes among the ladies and much laughter, when
it appeared that the priestess of the hidden spell, in her working, had
mixed up the oracles.&nbsp; Jacob had manifestly got Esau&rsquo;s
blessing.&nbsp; It was agreed that the <i>bonnes fortunes</i> should be
exchanged, that the shillings might not be regarded as lost, and all this
was explained to the unmarried lady.&nbsp; She said nothing, but in due
time was also <i>dukkered</i> or fortune-told.&nbsp; With the same mystery
she was conducted <!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>to the secluded corner of the hedge, and a
very long, low-murmuring colloquy ensued.&nbsp; What it was we never knew,
but the lady had evidently been greatly impressed and awed.&nbsp; All that
she would tell was that she had heard things that were &ldquo;very
remarkable, which she was sure no person living could have known,&rdquo;
and in fact that she believed in the gypsy, and even the blunder as to the
married lady and the widow, and all my assurances that chiromancy as
popularly practiced was all humbug, made no impression.&nbsp; There was
once &ldquo;a disciple in Yabneh&rdquo; who gave a hundred and fifty
reasons to prove that a reptile was no more unclean than any other
animal.&nbsp; But in those days people had not been converted to the law of
turtle soup and the gospel of Saint Terrapin, so the people said it was a
vain thing.&nbsp; And had I given a hundred and fifty reasons to this lady,
they would have all been vain to her, for she wished to believe; and when
our own wishes are served up unto us on nice brown pieces of the
well-buttered toast of flattery, it is not hard to induce us to devour
them.</p>
<p>It is written that when Ashmedai, or Asmodeus, the chief of all the
devils of mischief, was being led a captive to Solomon, he did several
mysterious things while on the way, among others bursting into extravagant
laughter, when he saw a magician conjuring and predicting.&nbsp; On being
questioned by Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, why he had seemed so much
amused, Ashmedai answered that it was because the seer was at the very time
sitting on a princely treasure, and he did not, with all his magic and
promising fortune to others, know this.&nbsp; Yet, if this had been told to
all the world, the conjurer&rsquo;s business would <!-- page 150--><a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>not have
suffered.&nbsp; Not a bit of it.&nbsp; <i>Entre Jean</i>, <i>passe
Jeannot</i>: one comes and goes, another takes his place, and the poor will
disappear from this world before the too credulous shall have departed.</p>
<p>It was on the afternoon of the following day that I, by chance, met the
gypsy with a female friend, each with a basket, by the roadside, in a
lonely, furzy place, beyond Walton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a nice fortune-teller, aren&rsquo;t you now?&rdquo; I
said to her.&nbsp; &ldquo;After getting a tip, which made it all as clear
as day, you walk straight into the dark.&nbsp; And here you promise a lady
two husbands, and she married already; but you never promised me two wives,
that I might make merry withal.&nbsp; And then to tell a widow that she
would never be married again!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a <i>bori chovihani</i> [a
great witch],&mdash;indeed, you aren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Rye</i>,&rdquo; said the gypsy, with a droll smile and a
shrug,&mdash;I think I can see it now,&mdash;&ldquo;the <i>dukkerin</i>
[prediction] was all right, but I pet the right <i>dukkerins</i> on the
wrong ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Master said, &ldquo;I write letters, but I am not the
messenger.&rdquo;&nbsp; His orders, like the gypsy&rsquo;s, had been all
right, but they had gone to the wrong shop.&nbsp; Thus, in all ages, those
who affect superior wisdom and foreknowledge absolute have found that a
great practical part of the real business consisted in the plausible
explanation of failures.&nbsp; The great Canadian weather prophet is said
to keep two clerks busy, one in recording his predictions, the other in
explaining their failures; which is much the case with the rain-doctors in
Africa, who are as ingenious and fortunate in explaining a miss as a hit,
as, indeed, they need be, since they must, in case of error, submit <!--
page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>to be
devoured alive by ants,&mdash;insects which in Africa correspond in several
respects to editors and critics, particularly the stinging kind.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Und ist man bei der Prophezeiung angestellt</i>,&rdquo; as Heine
says; &ldquo;when a man has a situation in a prophecy-office,&rdquo; a
great part of his business is to explain to the customers why it is that so
many of them draw blanks, or why the trains of fate are never on time.</p>

152</span>V.&nbsp; HAMPTON RACES.</h3>
<p>On a summer day, when waking dreams softly wave before the fancy, it is
pleasant to walk in the noon-stillness along the Thames, for then we pass a
series of pictures forming a gallery which I would not exchange for that of
the Louvre, could I impress them as indelibly upon the eye-memory as its
works are fixed on canvas.&nbsp; There exists in all of us a spiritual
photographic apparatus, by means of which we might retain accurately all we
have ever seen, and bring out, at will, the pictures from the pigeon-holes
of the memory, or make new ones as vivid as aught we see in dreams, but the
faculty must be developed in childhood.&nbsp; So surely as I am now writing
this will become, at some future day, a branch of education, to be
developed into results of which the wildest imagination can form no
conception, and I put the prediction on record.&nbsp; As it is, I am sorry
that I was never trained to this half-thinking, half-painting art, since,
if I had been, I should have left for distant days to come some charming
views of Surrey as it appears in this decade.</p>
<p>The reedy eyots and the rising hills; the level meadows and the little
villes, with their antique perpendicular Gothic churches, which form the
points around which they have clustered for centuries, even as groups of
boats in the river are tied around their mooring-posts; <!-- page 153--><a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>the bridges and trim
cottages or elegant mansions with their flower-bordered grounds sweeping
down to the water&rsquo;s edge, looking like rich carpets with new baize
over the centre, make the pictures of which I speak, varying with every
turn of the Thames; while the river itself is, at this season, like a
continual regatta, with many kinds of boats, propelled by stalwart young
Englishmen or healthy, handsome damsels, of every rank, the better class by
far predominating.&nbsp; There is a disposition among the English to don
quaint holiday attire, to put on the picturesque, and go to the very limits
which custom permits, which would astonish an American.&nbsp; Of late years
this is becoming the case, too, in Trans-Atlantis, but it has always been
usual in England, to mark the f&ecirc;te day with a festive dress, to wear
gay ribbons, and to indulge the very harmless instinct of youth to be
gallant and gay.</p>
<p>I had started one morning on a walk by the Thames, when I met a friend,
who asked,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to-day to the Hampton races?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just six miles.&nbsp; On Molesy Hurst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Six miles, and I had only six shillings in my pocket.&nbsp; I had some
curiosity to see this race, which is run on the Molesy Hurst, famous as the
great place for prize-fighting in the olden time, and which has never been
able to raise itself to respectability, inasmuch as the local chronicler
says that &ldquo;the course attracts considerable and not very reputable
gatherings.&rdquo;&nbsp; In fact, it is generally spoken of as the
Costermonger&rsquo;s race, at which a mere welsher is a comparatively
respectable character, and every man in a good coat a swell.&nbsp; I was
nicely attired, by chance, for the occasion, <!-- page 154--><a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>for I had come out,
thinking of a ride, in a white hat, new corduroy pantaloons and waistcoat,
and a velveteen coat, which dress is so greatly admired by the gypsies that
it may almost be regarded as their &ldquo;national costume.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was certainly, to say the least, a rather <i>bourgeois</i> tone at
the race, and gentility was conspicuous by its absence; but I did not find
it so outrageously low as I had been led to expect.&nbsp; I confess that I
was not encouraged to attempt to increase my little hoard of silver by
betting, and the certainty that if I lost I could not lunch made me
timid.&nbsp; But the good are never alone in this world, and I found
friends whom I dreamed not of.&nbsp; Leaving the crowd, I sought the gypsy
vans, and by one of these was old Liz Buckland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sarishan rye</i>!&nbsp; And glad I am to see you.&nbsp; Why
didn&rsquo;t you come down into Kent to see the hoppin&rsquo;?&nbsp; Many a
time the Romanys says they expected to see their <i>rye</i> there.&nbsp;
Just the other night, your Coopers was a-lyin&rsquo; round their fire,
every one of &rsquo;em in a new red blanket, lookin&rsquo; so beautiful as
the light shone on &rsquo;em, and I says, &lsquo;If our <i>rye</i> was to
see you, he&rsquo;d just have that book of his out, and take all your
pictures.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>After much gossip over absent friends, I said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, <i>dye</i>, I stand a shilling for beer, and that&rsquo;s
all I can do to-day, for I&rsquo;ve come out with only <i>shove
trin-grushi</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Liz took the shilling, looked at it and at me with an earnest air, and
shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll never do, <i>rye</i>,&mdash;never.&nbsp; A gentleman
wants more than six shillin&rsquo;s to see a race through, and a
reg&rsquo;lar Romany rye like you ought to slap down his <!-- page 155--><a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span><i>lovvo</i> with the
best of &rsquo;em for the credit of his people.&nbsp; And if you want a
<i>bar</i> [a pound] or two, I&rsquo;ll lend you the money, and never fear
about your payment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was kind of the old <i>dye</i>, but I thought that I would pull
through on my five shillings, before I would draw on the Romany bank.&nbsp;
To be considered with sincere sympathy, as an object of deserving charity,
on the lowest race-ground in England, and to be offered eleemosynary relief
by a gypsy, was, indeed, touching the hard pan of humiliation.&nbsp; I went
my way, idly strolling about, mingling affably with all orders, for my
watch was at home.&nbsp; <i>Vacuus viator cantabit</i>.&nbsp; As I stood by
a fence, I heard a gentlemanly-looking young man, who was evidently a
superior pickpocket, or &ldquo;a regular fly gonoff,&rdquo; say to a
friend,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s on the ground,&mdash;a great woman among the
gypsies.&nbsp; What do they call her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Lee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; A swell Romany she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whenever one hears an Englishman, not a scholar, speak of gypsies as
&ldquo;Romany,&rdquo; he may be sure that man is rather more on the loose
than becomes a steady citizen, and that he walks in ways which, if not of
darkness, are at least in a shady <i>demi-jour</i>, with a gentle down
grade.&nbsp; I do not think there was anybody on the race-ground who was
not familiar with the older word.</p>
<p>It began to rain, and before long my new velveteen coat was very
wet.&nbsp; I looked among the booths for one where I might dry myself and
get something to eat, and, entering the largest, was struck by the
appearance of the landlady.&nbsp; She was a young and decidedly pretty
woman, nicely dressed, and was unmistakably <!-- page 156--><a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>gypsy.&nbsp; I had
never seen her before, but I knew who she was by a description I had
heard.&nbsp; So I went up to the bar and spoke:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you, Agnes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bloomin&rsquo;.&nbsp; What will you have, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dui curro levinor</i>, <i>yeck for tute</i>, <i>yeck for
mandy</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Two glasses for ale,&mdash;one for you, one for
me.)</p>
<p>She looked up with a quick glance and a wondering smile, and then
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be the Romany rye of the Coopers.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad
to see you.&nbsp; Bless me, how wet you are.&nbsp; Go to the fire and dry
yourself.&nbsp; Here, Bill, I say!&nbsp; Attend to this
gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a tremendous roaring fire at the farther end of the booth, at
which were pieces of meat, so enormous as to suggest a giant&rsquo;s roast
or a political barbecue rather than a kitchen.&nbsp; I glanced with some
interest at Bill, who came to aid me.&nbsp; In all my life I never saw a
man who looked so thoroughly the regular English bull-dog bruiser of the
lowest type, but battered and worn out.&nbsp; His nose, by oft-repeated
pummeling, had gradually subsided almost to a level with his other
features, just as an ancient British grave subsides, under the pelting
storms of centuries, into equality with the plain.&nbsp; His eyes looked
out from under their bristly eaves like sleepy wild-cats from a pig-pen,
and his physique was tremendous.&nbsp; He noticed my look of curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Bruisin&rsquo; Bill, your honor.&nbsp; I was well knowed in
the prize-ring once.&nbsp; Been in the newspapers.&nbsp; Now, you
mus&rsquo;n&rsquo;t dry your coat that way!&nbsp; New welweteen ought
always to be wiped afore you dry it.&nbsp; I was a gamekeeper myself for
six years, an&rsquo; wore it all that time nice and proper, I did, and know
how <!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>may be you&rsquo;ve got a thrip&rsquo;ny bit for old Bill.&nbsp;
Thanky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I will do Mrs. Agnes Wynn the credit to say that in her booth the best
and most abundant meal that I ever saw for the price in England was given
for eighteen pence.&nbsp; Fed and dried, I was talking with her, when there
came up a pretty boy of ten, so neat and well dressed and altogether so
nice that he might have passed current for a gentleman&rsquo;s son
anywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Agnes.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re Wynn by name and winsome by
nature, and all the best you have has gone into that boy.&nbsp; They say
you gypsies used to steal children.&nbsp; I think it&rsquo;s time to turn
the tables, and when I take the game up I&rsquo;ll begin by stealing your
<i>chavo</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Wynn looked pleased.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is a good boy, as good as he
looks, and he goes to school, and don&rsquo;t keep low company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here two or three octoroon, duodecaroon, or vigintiroon Romany female
friends of the landlady came up to be introduced to me, and of course to
take something at my expense for the good of the house.&nbsp; This they did
in the manner specially favored by gypsies; that is to say, a quart of ale,
being ordered, was offered first to me, in honor of my social position, and
then passed about from hand to hand.&nbsp; This rite accomplished, I went
forth to view the race.&nbsp; The sun had begun to shine again, the damp
flags and streamers had dried themselves in its cheering rays, even as I
had renewed myself at Dame Wynn&rsquo;s fire, and I crossed the
race-course.&nbsp; The scene was lively, picturesque, and thoroughly
English.&nbsp; There are certain pleasures and pursuits which, however <!--
page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>they
may be perfected in other countries, always seem to belong especially to
England, and chief among these is the turf.&nbsp; As a fresh start was
made, as the spectators rushed to the ropes, roaring with excitement, and
the horses swept by amid hurrahs, I could realize the sympathetic feeling
which had been developed in all present by ancient familiarity and many
associations with such scenes.&nbsp; Whatever the moral value of these may
be, it is certain that anything so racy with local color and so distinctly
fixed in popular affection as the <i>race</i> will always appeal to the
artist and the student of national scenes.</p>
<p>I found Old Liz lounging with Old Dick, her husband, on the other
side.&nbsp; There was a canvas screen, eight feet high, stretched as a
background to stop the sticks hurled by the players at
&ldquo;coker-nuts,&rdquo; while the nuts themselves, each resting on a
stick five feet high, looked like disconsolate and starved spectres,
waiting to be cruelly treated.&nbsp; In company with the old couple was a
commanding-looking, eagle-eyed Romany woman, in whom I at once recognized
the remarkable gypsy spoken of by the pickpocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Lee,&rdquo; she said, in answer to my greeting.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What is yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have added land to the lee.&nbsp; You are luckier than I
am.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a Lee without land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke she looked like an ideal Meg Merrilies, and I wished I had
her picture.&nbsp; It was very strange that I made the wish at that
instant, for just then she was within an ace of having it taken, and
therefore arose and went away to avoid it.&nbsp; An itinerant photographer,
seeing me talking with the gypsies, was attempting, though I knew it not,
to take <!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>the group.&nbsp; But the keen eye of the Romany saw it all, and
she went her way, because she was of the real old kind, who believe it is
unlucky to have their portraits taken.&nbsp; I used to think that this
aversion was of the same kind as that which many good men evince in a
marked manner when requested by the police to sit for their photographs for
the rogues&rsquo; gallery.&nbsp; But here I did the gypsies great
injustice; for they will allow their likenesses to be taken if you will
give them a shoe-string.&nbsp; That this old superstition relative to the
binding and loosing of ill-luck by the shoe-string should exist in this
connection is of itself curious.&nbsp; In the earliest times the
shoe-latchet brought luck, just as the shoe itself did, especially when
filled with corn or rice, and thrown after the bride.&nbsp; It is a great
pity that the ignorant Gentiles, who are so careful to do this at every
wedding, do not know that it is all in vain unless they cry aloud in
Hebrew, &ldquo;<i>Peru urphu</i>!&rdquo; <a name="citation159"></a><a
href="#footnote159" class="citation">[159]</a> with all their might when
the shoe is cast, and that the shoe should be filled with rice.</p>
<p>She went away, and in a few minutes the photographer came in great glee
to show a picture which he had taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere you are, sir.&nbsp; An elegant photograph,
surroundin&rsquo; sentimental scenery and horiental coker-nuts thrown
in,&mdash;all for a diminitive little shillin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that time you missed it,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;for on my
honor as a gentleman, I have only ninepence in all my pockets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gent like you with only ninepence!&rdquo; said the artist.</p>
<p><!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>&ldquo;If he hasn&rsquo;t got money in his pocket now,&rdquo;
said Old Liz, speaking up in my defense, &ldquo;he has plenty at
home.&nbsp; He has given pounds and pounds to us gypsies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dovo&rsquo;s a huckaben</i>,&rdquo; I said to her in
Romany.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Mandy kekker delled tute k&#363;mi&rsquo;n a
trin-grushi</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; (That is untrue.&nbsp; I never gave you more
than a shilling.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; said Liz, &ldquo;ninepence is enough for
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the man, assenting, gave it to me.&nbsp; It was a very
good picture, and I have since had several copies taken of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>rya</i>,&rdquo; said Old Liz, when I regretted the
absence of my Lady Lee, and talked with her about shoe-strings and old
shoes, and how necessary it was to cry out &ldquo;<i>Peru urphu</i>!&rdquo;
when you throw them,&mdash;&ldquo;yes.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the way the
Gorgis always half does things.&nbsp; You see &rsquo;em get a horse-shoe
off the roads, and what do they do with it!&nbsp; Goes like <i>dinneli</i>
idiots and nails it up with the p&rsquo;ints down, which, as is well
beknown, brings all the bad luck there is flyin&rsquo; in the air into the
house, and <i>taders chovihanees</i> [draws witches] like anise-seed does
rats.&nbsp; Now common sense ought to teach that the shoe ought to be put
like horns, with the p&rsquo;ints up.&nbsp; For if it&rsquo;s lucky to put
real horns up, of course the horse-shoe goes the same <i>drom</i>
[road].&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s lucky to pick up a red string in the
morning,&mdash;yes, or at any time; but it&rsquo;s sure love from a girl if
you do,&mdash;specially silk.&nbsp; And if so be she gives you a red string
or cord, or a strip of red stuff, <i>that</i> means she&rsquo;ll be bound
to you and loves you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>London, during hot weather, after the close of the wise season, suggests
to the upper ten thousand, and to the lower twenty thousand who reflect
their ways, and to the lowest millions who minister to them all, a scene of
doleful dullness.&nbsp; I call the time which has passed wise, because that
which succeeds is universally known as the silly season.&nbsp; Then the
editors in town have recourse to the American newspapers for amusing
murders, while their rural brethren invent great gooseberries.&nbsp; Then
the sea-serpent again lifts his awful head.&nbsp; I am always glad when
this sterling inheritance of the Northern races reappears; for while we
have <i>him</i> I know that the capacity for swallowing a big bouncer, or
for inventing one, is not lost.&nbsp; He is characteristic of a fine, bold
race.&nbsp; Long may he wave!&nbsp; It is true that we cannot lie as
gloriously as our ancestors did about him.&nbsp; When the great news-dealer
of Norse times had no home-news he took his lyre, and either spun a yarn
about Vinland such as would smash the &ldquo;Telegraph,&rdquo; or else sung
about &ldquo;that sea-snake tremendous curled, whose girth encircles half
the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is wonderful, it is awful, to consider how true
we remain to the traditions of the older time.&nbsp; The French boast that
they invented the <i>canard</i>.&nbsp; Let them boast.&nbsp; They also
invented the shirt-collar; but hoary legends say that an Englishman <!--
page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>invented the shirt for it, as well as the art of washing
it.&nbsp; What the shirt is to the collar, that is the glorious, tough old
Northern <i>saga</i>, or maritime spun yarn, to the <i>canard</i>, or
duck.&nbsp; The yarn will wash; it passes into myth and history; it fits
exactly, because it was made to order; its age and glory illustrate the
survival of the fittest.</p>
<p>I have, during three or four summers, remained a month in London after
the family had taken flight to the sea-side.&nbsp; I stayed to finish books
promised for the autumn.&nbsp; It is true that nearly four million of
people remain in London during the later summer; but it is wonderful what
an influence the absence of a few exerts on them and on the town.&nbsp;
Then you realize by the long lines of idle vehicles in the ranks how few
people in this world can afford a cab; then you find out how scanty is the
number of those who buy goods at the really excellent shops; and then you
may finally find out by satisfactory experience, if you are inclined to
grumble at your lot in life or your fortune, how much better off you are
than ninety-nine in a hundred of your fellow-murmurers at fate.</p>
<p>It was my wont to walk out in the cool of the evening, to smoke my cigar
in Regent&rsquo;s Park, seated on a bench, watching the children as they
played about the clock-and-bull fountain,&mdash;for it embraces these
objects among its adornments,&mdash;presented by Cowasie Jehanguire, who
added to these magnificent Persian names the prosaic English postscript of
Ready Money.&nbsp; In this his name sets forth the history of his Parsee
people, who, from being heroic Ghebers, have come down to being bankers,
who can &ldquo;do&rdquo; any Jew, and who might possibly tackle a Yankee so
long as they kept out of New Jersey.&nbsp; One evening I <!-- page 163--><a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>walked outside of the
Park, passing by the Gloucester Bridge to a little walk or boulevard, where
there are a few benches.&nbsp; I was in deep moon-shadow, formed by the
trees; only the ends of my boots shone like eyes in the moonlight as I put
them out.&nbsp; After a while I saw a nice-looking young girl, of the
humble-decent class, seated by me, and with her I entered into casual
conversation.&nbsp; On the bench behind us were two young Italians,
conversing in strongly marked Florentine dialect.&nbsp; They evidently
thought that no one could understand them; as they became more interested
they spoke more distinctly, letting out secrets which I by no means wished
to hear.</p>
<p>At that instant I recalled the famous story of Prince Bismarck and the
Esthonian young ladies and the watch-key.&nbsp; I whispered to the
girl,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I say something to you in a language which you do not
understand, answer &lsquo;<i>Si</i>&rsquo; as distinctly as you
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The damsel was quick to understand.&nbsp; An instant after I
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ha veduto il mio &rsquo;havallo la sera</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Si</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a dead silence, and then a rise and a rush.&nbsp; My young
friend rolled her eyes up at me, but said nothing.&nbsp; The Italians had
departed with their awful mysteries.&nbsp; Then there came by a man who
looked much worse.&nbsp; He was a truculent, untamable rough, evidently
inspired with gin.&nbsp; At a glance I saw by the manner in which he
carried his coat that he was a traveler, or one who lived on the
roads.&nbsp; Seeing me he stopped, and said, grimly,&mdash;&ldquo;Do you
love your Jesus?&rdquo;&nbsp; This is certainly a pious question; but it
was <!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>uttered in a tone which intimated that if I did not answer it
affirmatively I might expect anything but Christian treatment.&nbsp; I knew
why the man uttered it.&nbsp; He had just come by an open-air preaching in
the Park, and the phrase had, moreover, been recently chalked and stenciled
by numerous zealous and busy nonconformists all over northwestern
London.&nbsp; I smiled, and said, quietly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Pal</i>, <i>mor rakker s&#257; drov&aacute;n</i>.&nbsp;
<i>J&#257; pukenus on the drum</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Don&rsquo;t talk so loud,
brother.&nbsp; Go away quietly.)</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s whole manner changed.&nbsp; As if quite sober, he
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mang your shunaben</i>, <i>rye</i>.&nbsp; <i>But tute jins
chomany</i>.&nbsp; <i>Kushti ratti</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; (Beg your pardon,
sir.&nbsp; But you <i>do</i> know a thing or two.&nbsp; Good-night!)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was awfully frightened,&rdquo; said the young girl, as the
traveler departed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he meant to pitch into
us.&nbsp; But what a wonderful way you have, sir, of sending people
away!&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t so much astonished when you got rid of the
Italians.&nbsp; I suppose ladies and gentlemen know Italian, or else they
wouldn&rsquo;t go to the opera.&nbsp; But this man was a common, bad
English tramp; yet I&rsquo;m sure he spoke to you in some kind of strange
language, and you said something to him that changed him into as peaceable
as could be.&nbsp; What was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was gypsy, young lady,&mdash;what the gypsies talk among
themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, sir, I think you&rsquo;re the most mysterious
gentleman I ever met.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely.&nbsp; Good-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>I was walking with my friend the Palmer, one afternoon in June,
in one of the several squares which lie to the west of the British
Museum.&nbsp; As we went I saw a singular-looking, slightly-built man,
lounging at a corner.&nbsp; He was wretchedly clad, and appeared to be
selling some rudely-made, but curious contrivances of notched sticks,
intended to contain flowerpots.&nbsp; He also had flower-holders made of
twisted copper wire.&nbsp; But the greatest curiosity was the man
himself.&nbsp; He had such a wild, wasted, wistful expression, a face
marked with a life of almost unconscious misery.&nbsp; And most palpable in
it was the unrest, which spoke of an endless struggle with life, and had
ended by goading him into incessant wandering.&nbsp; I cannot imagine what
people can be made of who can look at such men without emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a gypsy,&rdquo; I said to the Palmer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Sarishan</i>, <i>pal</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wanderer seemed to be greatly pleased to hear Romany.&nbsp; He
declared that he was in the habit of talking it so much to himself when
alone that his ordinary name was Romany Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you come down to the Potteries, and want to find me, you
mus&rsquo;n&rsquo;t ask for Romany Dick, but Divius Dick.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;That means Wild Dick.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And why?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Because I wander about so, and can
never stay more than a night in any one place.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t help
it.&nbsp; I must keep going.&rdquo;&nbsp; He said this with that wistful,
sad expression, a yearning as for something which he had never
comprehended.&nbsp; Was it <i>rest</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so I <i>rakker</i> Romany [talk gypsy to myself], when
I&rsquo;m alone of a night, when the wind blows.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s better
company than talkin&rsquo; Gorginess.&nbsp; More sociable.&nbsp; <i>He</i>
says&mdash;no&mdash;<i>I</i> say more sensible things <!-- page 166--><a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>Romaneskas than in
English.&nbsp; You understand me?&rdquo; he exclaimed suddenly, with the
same wistful stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s quite reasonable.&nbsp; It must be
like having two heads instead of one, and being twice as knowing as anybody
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it.&nbsp; But everybody don&rsquo;t know
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you ask for one of those flower-stands, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A shillin&rsquo;, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here is my name and where I live, on an envelope.&nbsp; And
here are two shillings.&nbsp; But if you <i>chore mandy</i> [cheat me] and
don&rsquo;t leave it at the house, I&rsquo;ll look you up in the Potteries,
and <i>koor tute</i> [whip you].&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at me very seriously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, yes.&nbsp; You could
<i>koor me kenn&#257;</i> [whip me now].&nbsp; But you couldn&rsquo;t have
<i>koored</i> my <i>dadas</i> [whipped my father].&nbsp; Leastways not
afore he got his leg broken fightin&rsquo; Lancaster Sam.&nbsp; You must
have heard of my father,&mdash;Single-stick Dick.&nbsp; But if
your&rsquo;re comin&rsquo; down to the Potteries, don&rsquo;t come next
Sunday.&nbsp; Come Sunday three weeks.&nbsp; My brother is <i>stardo
kenn&#257;</i> for <i>chorin</i> a <i>gry</i> [in prison for
horse-stealing].&nbsp; In three weeks he&rsquo;ll be let out, and
we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to have a great family party to welcome him, and
we&rsquo;ll be glad to see you.&nbsp; Do come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The flower-stand was faithfully delivered, but another engagement
prevented an acceptance of the invitation, and I have never seen Dick
since.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>I was walking along Marylebone Road, which always seems to be a worn and
wind-beaten street, very pretty once, and now repenting it; when just
beyond Baker Street station I saw a gypsy van <!-- page 167--><a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>hung all round with
baskets and wooden-ware.&nbsp; Smoke issued from its pipe, and it went
along smoking like any careless pedestrian.&nbsp; It always seems strange
to think of a family being thus conveyed with its dinner cooking, the
children playing about the stove, over rural roads, past common and gorse
and hedge, in and out of villages, and through Great Babylon itself, as if
the family had a <i>pied &agrave; terre</i>, and were as secluded all the
time as though they lived in Little Pedlington or Tinnecum.&nbsp; For they
have just the same narrow range of gossip, and just the same set of
friends, though the set are always on the move.&nbsp; Traveling does not
make a cosmopolite.</p>
<p>By the van strolled the lord and master, with his wife.&nbsp; I accosted
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sarishan</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sarishan rye</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see me before?&nbsp; Do you know me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for that.&nbsp; I have a nice velveteen coat
which I have been keeping for your father.&nbsp; How&rsquo;s your brother
Frank?&nbsp; Traveling about Kingston, I suppose.&nbsp; As usual.&nbsp; But
I don&rsquo;t care about trusting the coat to anybody who don&rsquo;t know
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it to him, safe enough, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I dare say.&nbsp; On your back.&nbsp; And wear it yourself
six months before you see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up spoke his wife: &ldquo;That he shan&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take
good care that the <i>pooro mush</i> [the old man] gets it all right, in a
week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, <i>dye</i>, I can trust you.&nbsp; You remember me.&nbsp;
And, Anselo, here is my address.&nbsp; Come to the house in half an
hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>In half an hour the housekeeper, said with a quiet
smile,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, sir, there&rsquo;s a gentleman&mdash;a
<i>gypsy</i> gentleman&mdash;wishes to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is an English theory that the master can have no
&ldquo;visitors&rdquo; who are not gentlemen.&nbsp; I must admit that
Anselo&rsquo;s dress was not what could be called gentlemanly.&nbsp; From
his hat to his stout shoes he looked the impenitent gypsy and sinful
poacher, unaffected and natural.&nbsp; There was a cutaway, sporting look
about his coat which indicated that he had grown to it from boyhood
&ldquo;in woodis grene.&rdquo;&nbsp; He held a heavy-handled whip, a
regular Romany <i>tchupni</i> or <i>ch&#363;ckni</i>, which Mr. Borrow
thinks gave rise to the word &ldquo;jockey.&rdquo;&nbsp; I thought the same
once, but have changed my mind, for there were &ldquo;jockeys&rdquo; in
England before gypsies.&nbsp; Altogether, Anselo (which comes from
Wenceslas) was a determined and vigorous specimen of an old-fashioned
English gypsy, a type which, with all its faults, is not wanting in sundry
manly virtues.</p>
<p>I knew that Anselo rarely entered any houses save ale-houses, and that
he had probably never before been in a study full of books, arms, and
bric-a-brac.&nbsp; And he knew that I was aware of it.&nbsp; Now, if he had
been more of a fool, like a red Indian or an old-fashioned fop, he would
have affected a stoical indifference, for fear of showing his
ignorance.&nbsp; As it was, he sat down in an arm-chair, glanced about him,
and said just the right thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be a pleasant thing, at the end of the day, after one has
been running about, to come home to such a room as this, so full of fine
things, and sit down in such a comfortable chair.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Will
I have <!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>a glass of old ale?&nbsp; Yes, I thank you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;That is <i>kushto levinor</i> [good ale].&nbsp; I never tasted
better.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Would I rather have wine or spirits?&nbsp; No,
I thank you; such ale as this is fit for a king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Anselo&rsquo;s keen eye suddenly rested on something which he
understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a beautiful little rifle!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I call a
<i>rinkno y&#257;g-engree</i> [pretty gun].&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has it been a <i>wafedo wen</i> [hard winter], Anselo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been a dreadful winter, sir.&nbsp; We have been hard put
to it sometimes for food.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s dreadful to think of.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve acti&rsquo;lly seen the time when I was almost desperated, and
if I&rsquo;d had such a gun as that I&rsquo;m afraid, if I&rsquo;d been
tempted, I could a-found it in my heart to knock over a
pheasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked sympathetically at Anselo.&nbsp; The idea of his having been
brought to the very brink of such a terrible temptation and awful crime was
touching.&nbsp; He met the glance with the expression of a good man, who
had done no more than his duty, closed his eyes, and softly shook his
head.&nbsp; Then he took another glass of ale, as if the memory of the
pheasants or something connected with the subject had been too much for
him, and spoke:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came here on my horse.&nbsp; But he&rsquo;s an ugly old white
punch.&nbsp; So as not to discredit you, I left him standing before a
gentleman&rsquo;s house, two doors off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Anselo paused.&nbsp; I acknowledged this touching act of thoughtful
delicacy by raising my glass.&nbsp; He drank again, then
resumed:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I feel uneasy about leaving a horse by himself in the streets
of London.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll stand like a driven nail wherever you put
him&mdash;but there&rsquo;s always plenty of claw-hammers to draw such
nails.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, Anselo.&nbsp; The park-keeper will
not let anybody take him through the gates.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll pay for him if
he goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But visions of a stolen horse seemed to haunt Anselo.&nbsp; One would
have thought that something of the kind had been familiar to him.&nbsp; So
I sent for the velveteen coat, and, folding it on his arm, he mounted the
old white horse, while waving an adieu with the heavy-handled whip, rode
away in the mist, and was seen no more.</p>
<p>Farewell, farewell, thou old brown velveteen!&nbsp; I had thee first in
by-gone years, afar, hunting ferocious fox and horrid hare, near Brighton,
on the Downs, and wore thee well on many a sketching tour to churches old
and castles dark or gray, when winter went with all his raines wete.&nbsp;
Farewell, my coat, and benedicite!&nbsp; I bore thee over France unto
Marseilles, and on the steamer where we took aboard two hundred Paynim
pilgrims of Mahound.&nbsp; Farewell, my coat, and benedicite!&nbsp; Thou
wert in Naples by great Virgil&rsquo;s tomb, and borest dust from
Posilippo&rsquo;s grot, and hast been wetted by the dainty spray from bays
and shoals of old Etrurian name.&nbsp; Farewell, my coat, and
benedicite!&nbsp; And thou wert in the old Egyptian realm: I had thee on
that morning &rsquo;neath the palms when long I lingered where of yore had
stood the rose-red city, half as old as time.&nbsp; Farewell, my coat, and
benedicite!&nbsp; It was a lady called thee into life.&nbsp; She said,
Methinks ye need a velvet coat.&nbsp; It is a seemly guise to ride to
hounds.&nbsp; Another gave me whip and silvered spurs.&nbsp; Now all have
vanished in the darkening past.&nbsp; Ladies and all are gone into the
gloom.&nbsp; Farewell, my coat, and benedicite.&nbsp; Thou&rsquo;st had a
venturous and traveled life, for thou <!-- page 171--><a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>wert once in Moscow
in the snow.&nbsp; A true Bohemian thou hast ever been, and as a right
Bohemian thou wilt die, the garment of a roving Romany.&nbsp; Fain would I
see and hear what thou&rsquo;rt to know of reckless riding and the gypsy
<i>tan</i>, of camps in dark green lanes, afar from towns.&nbsp; Farewell,
mine coat, and benedicite!</p>

172</span>VII.&nbsp; OF CERTAIN GENTLEMEN AND GYPSIES.</h3>
<p>One morning I was walking with Mr. Thomas Carlyle and Mr. Froude.&nbsp;
We went across Hyde Park, and paused to rest on the bridge.&nbsp; This is a
remarkable place, since there, in the very heart of London, one sees a view
which is perfectly rural.&nbsp; The old oaks rise above each other like
green waves, the houses in the distance are country-like, while over the
trees, and far away, a village-looking spire completes the picture.&nbsp; I
think that it was Mr. Froude who called my attention to the beauty of the
view, and I remarked that it needed only a gypsy tent and the curling smoke
to make it in all respects perfectly English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have paid some attention to gypsies,&rdquo; said Mr.
Carlyle.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not altogether so bad a people as many
think.&nbsp; In Scotland, we used to see many of them.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not
say that they were not rovers and reivers, but they could be honest at
times.&nbsp; The country folk feared them, but those who made friends
wi&rsquo; them had no cause to complain of their conduct.&nbsp; Once there
was a man who was persuaded to lend a gypsy a large sum of money.&nbsp; My
father knew the man.&nbsp; It was to be repaid at a certain time.&nbsp; The
day came; the gypsy did not.&nbsp; And months passed, and still the
creditor had nothing of money but the memory of it; and ye remember <!--
page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>&lsquo;<i>nessun maggior dolore</i>,&rsquo;&mdash;that
there&rsquo;s na greater grief than to remember the siller ye once
had.&nbsp; Weel, one day the man was surprised to hear that his
frien&rsquo; the gypsy wanted to see him&mdash;interview, ye call it in
America.&nbsp; And the gypsy explained that, having been arrested, and
unfortunately detained, by some little accident, in preeson, he had na been
able to keep his engagement.&nbsp; &lsquo;If ye&rsquo;ll just gang
wi&rsquo; me,&rsquo; said the gypsy, &lsquo;aw&rsquo;ll mak&rsquo; it all
right.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Mon, aw wull,&rsquo; said the
creditor,&mdash;they were Scotch, ye know, and spoke in deealect.&nbsp; So
the gypsy led the way to the house which he had inhabited, a cottage which
belonged to the man himself to whom he owed the money.&nbsp; And there he
lifted up the hearthstone; the hard-stane they call it in Scotland, and it
is called so in the prophecy of Thomas of Ercildowne.&nbsp; And under the
hard-stane there was an iron pot.&nbsp; It was full of gold, and out of
that gold the gypsy carle paid his creditor.&nbsp; Ye wonder how &rsquo;t
was come by?&nbsp; Well, ye&rsquo;ll have heard it&rsquo;s best to let
sleeping dogs lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; And what was said of the Poles who had, during the
Middle Ages, a reputation almost as good as that of gypsies?&nbsp; <i>Ad
secretas Poli</i>, <i>curas extendere noli</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Never concern
your soul as to the secrets of a Pole.)</p>
<p>Mr. Carlyle&rsquo;s story reminds me that Walter Simpson, in his history
of them, says that the Scottish gypsies have ever been distinguished for
their gratitude to those who treated them with civility and kindness, anent
which he tells a capital story, while other instances sparkle here and
there with many brilliant touches in his five hundred-and-fifty-page
volume.</p>
<p>I have more than once met with Romanys, when <!-- page 174--><a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>I was in the company
of men who, like Carlyle and Bilderdijk, &ldquo;were also in the world of
letters known,&rdquo; or who might say, &ldquo;We have deserved to
be.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of the many memories of golden days, all in the merrie
tyme of summer song in England, is of the Thames, and of a pleasure party
in a little steam-launch.&nbsp; It was a weenie affair,&mdash;just room for
six forward outside the cubby, which was called the cabin; and of these
six, one was Mr. Roebuck,&mdash;&ldquo;the last Englishman,&rdquo; as some
one has called him, but as the late Lord Lytton applies the same term to
one of his characters about the time of the Conquest, its accuracy may be
doubted.&nbsp; Say the last type of a certain phase of the Englishman; say
that Roebuck was the last of the old iron and oak men, the <i>triplex
&aelig;s et robur</i> chiefs of the Cobbet kind, and the phrase may
pass.&nbsp; But it will only pass over into a new variety of true
manhood.&nbsp; However frequently the last Englishman may die, I hope it
will be ever said of him, <i>Le roi est mort</i>,&mdash;<i>vive le
roi</i>!&nbsp; I have had talks with Lord Lytton on gypsies.&nbsp; He, too,
was once a Romany rye in a small way, and in the gay May heyday of his
young manhood once went off with a band of Romanys, and passed weeks in
their tents,&mdash;no bad thing, either, for anybody.&nbsp; I was more than
once tempted to tell him the strange fact that, though he had been among
the black people and thought he had learned their language, what they had
imposed upon him for that was not Romany, but cant, or English
thieves&rsquo; slang.&nbsp; For what is given, in good faith, as the gypsy
tongue in &ldquo;Paul Clifford&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Disowned,&rdquo; is
only the same old mumping <i>kennick</i> which was palmed off on Bampfylde
Moore Carew; or which he palmed on his readers, as the secret of <!-- page
175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>the
Roms.&nbsp; But what is the use or humanity of disillusioning an author by
correcting an error forty years old.&nbsp; If one could have corrected it
in the proof, <i>&agrave; la bonne heure</i>!&nbsp; Besides, it was of no
particular consequence to anybody whether the characters in &ldquo;Paul
Clifford&rdquo; called a clergyman a <i>patter-cove</i> or a
<i>rashai</i>.&nbsp; It is a supreme moment of triumph for a man when he
discovers that his specialty&mdash;whatever it be&mdash;is not of such
value as to be worth troubling anybody with it.&nbsp; As for Everybody,
<i>he</i> is fair game.</p>
<p>The boat went up the Thames, and I remember that the river was, that
morning, unusually beautiful.&nbsp; It is graceful, as in an outline, even
when leaden with November mists, or iron-gray in the drizzle of December,
but under the golden sunlight of June it is lovely.&nbsp; It becomes every
year, with gay boating parties in semi-fancy dresses, more of a carnival,
in which the carnivalers and their carnivalentines assume a more decided
character.&nbsp; It is very strange to see this tendency of the age to
unfold itself in new festival forms, when those who believe that there can
never be any poetry or picturing in life but in the past are wailing over
the vanishing of May-poles and old English sports.&nbsp; There may be, from
time to time, a pause between the acts; the curtain may be down a little
longer than usual; but in the long run the world-old play of the
Peoples&rsquo; Holiday will go on, as it has been going ever since Satan
suggested that little apple-stealing excursion to Eve, which, as explained
by the Talmudists, was manifestly the direct cause of all the flirtations
and other dreadful doings in all little outings down to the present day, in
the drawing-room or &ldquo;on the leads,&rdquo; world without end.</p>
<p>And as the boat went along by Weybridge we <!-- page 176--><a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>passed a bank by
which was a small gypsy camp; tents and wagons, donkeys and all, reflected
in the silent stream, as much as were the swans in the fore-water.&nbsp;
And in the camp was a tall, handsome, wild beauty, named Britannia, who
knew me well; a damsel fond of larking, with as much genuine devil&rsquo;s
gunpowder in her as would have made an entire pack or a Chinese hundred of
sixty-four of the small crackers known as fast girls, in or around
society.&nbsp; She was a splendid creature, long and lithe and lissom, but
well rounded, of a figure suggestive of leaping hedges; and as the sun
shone on her white teeth and burning black eyes, there was a hint of
biting, too, about her.&nbsp; She lay coiled and basking, in feline
fashion, in the sun; but at sight of me on the boat, up she bounded, and
ran along the bank, easily keeping up with the steamer, and crying out to
me in Romanes.</p>
<p>Now it just so happened that I by no means felt certain that <i>all</i>
of the company present were such genial Bohemians as to appreciate anything
like the joyous intimacy which Britannia was manifesting, as she,
Atalanta-like, coursed along.&nbsp; Consequently, I was not delighted with
her attentions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a fine girl!&rdquo; said Mr. Roebuck.&nbsp; &ldquo;How well
she would look on the stage!&nbsp; She seems to know you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said one of the ladies, &ldquo;or she would not
be speaking her language.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you answer her?&nbsp; Let
us hear a conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus adjured, I answered,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Miri pen</i>, <i>miri kushti pen</i>, <i>beng lel tute</i>,
<i>m&#257; rakker s&#257; drov&aacute;n</i>!&nbsp; <i>Or ma rakker
Romaneskas</i>.&nbsp; <i>M&#257;n dikesa te r&#257;nia shan akai</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Miri kameli</i>&mdash;<i>m&#257;n kair </i><!-- page 177--><a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span><i>mandy
ladge</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; (My sister, my nice, sweet sister!&mdash;devil take
you! don&rsquo;t hallo at me like that!&nbsp; Or else don&rsquo;t talk
Romany.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you see there are ladies here?&nbsp; My dear,
don&rsquo;t put me to shame!)</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Pen the rani ta wusser mandy a
trin-grushi</i>&mdash;<i>who</i>&mdash;<i>op</i>,
<i>hallo</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; (Tell the lady to shy me a
shilling&mdash;whoop!) cried the fast damsel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Pa miri duvels k&#257;m</i>, <i>pen</i>&mdash;<i>o bero se ta
duro</i>.&nbsp; <i>Mandy&rsquo;ll d&eacute; tute a pash-korauna keratti if
tu tevel j&#257;</i>.&nbsp; <i>Gorgie shan i foki kavakoi</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp;
(For the Lord&rsquo;s sake, sister!&mdash;the boat is too far from
shore.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give you half a crown this evening if you&rsquo;ll
clear out.&nbsp; These be Gentiles, these here.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to be a melodious language,&rdquo; said Mr. Roebuck,
greatly amused.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are you saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am telling her to hold her tongue, and go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how on earth does it happen that you speak such a
language?&rdquo; inquired a lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;I always thought that the
gypsies only talked a kind of English slang, and this sounds like a foreign
tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this time Britannia, like the Cork Leg, never tired, but kept on the
chase, neck and neck, till we reached a lock, when, with a merry laugh like
a child, she turned on her track and left us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. L.&rsquo;s proficiency in Romany,&rdquo; said Mr. Roebuck,
&ldquo;is well known to me.&nbsp; I have heard him spoken of as the
successor to George Borrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I do not deserve.&nbsp; There are
other gentlemen in England who are by far my superiors in knowledge of the
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I spoke very sincerely.&nbsp; Apropos of Mr. George Borrow, I knew
him, and a grand old fellow he was,&mdash;a fresh and hearty giant, holding
his six feet two or three inches as uprightly at eighty as he <!-- page
178--><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>ever had at
eighteen.&nbsp; I believe that was his age, but may be wrong.&nbsp; Borrow
was like one of the old Norse heroes, whom he so much admired, or an
old-fashioned gypsy bruiser, full of craft and merry tricks.&nbsp; One of
these he played on me, and I bear him no malice for it.&nbsp; The manner of
the joke was this: I had written a book on the English gypsies and their
language; but before I announced it, I wrote a letter to Father George,
telling him that I proposed to print it, and asking his permission to
dedicate it to him.&nbsp; He did not answer the letter, but &ldquo;worked
the tip&rdquo; promptly enough, for he immediately announced in the
newspapers on the following Monday his &ldquo;Word-Book of the Romany
Language,&rdquo; &ldquo;with many pieces in gypsy, illustrative of the way
of speaking and thinking of the English gypsies, with specimens of their
poetry, and an account of various things relating to gypsy life in
England.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was exactly what I had told him that my book
would contain; for I intended originally to publish a vocabulary.&nbsp;
Father George covered the track by not answering my letter; but I
subsequently ascertained that it had been faithfully delivered to him by a
gentleman from whom I obtained the information.</p>
<p>It was like the contest between Hildebrand the elder and his
son:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A ready trick tried Hildebrand,<br />
&nbsp;  That old, gray-bearded man;<br />
For when the younger raised to strike,<br />
&nbsp;  Beneath his sword he ran.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, like the son, I had no ill feeling about it.&nbsp; My obligations
to him for &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Romany Rye&rdquo; and his
other works are such as I owe to few men.&nbsp; I have enjoyed gypsying
more than any <!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>sport in the world, and I owe my love of it
all to George Borrow.&nbsp; I have since heard that a part of Mr.
Borrow&rsquo;s &ldquo;Romano Lavo-Lil&rdquo; had been in manuscript for
thirty years, and that it might never have been published but for my own
work.&nbsp; I hope that this is true; for I am sincerely proud to think
that I may have been in any way, directly or indirectly, the cause of his
giving it to the world.&nbsp; I would gladly enough have burnt my own book,
as I said, with a hearty laugh, when I saw the announcement of the
&ldquo;Lavo-Lil,&rdquo; if it would have pleased the old Romany rye, and I
never spoke a truer word.&nbsp; He would not have believed it; but it would
have been true, all the same.</p>
<p>I well remember the first time I met George Borrow.&nbsp; It was in the
British Museum, and I was introduced to him by Mrs. Estelle
Lewis,&mdash;now dead,&mdash;the well known-friend of Edgar A. Poe.&nbsp;
He was seated at a table, and had a large old German folio open before
him.&nbsp; We talked about gypsies, and I told him that I had
unquestionably found the word for &ldquo;green,&rdquo; <i>shelno</i>, in
use among the English Romany.&nbsp; He assented, and said that he knew
it.&nbsp; I mention this as a proof of the manner in which the
&ldquo;Romano Lavo-Lil&rdquo; must have been hurried, because he declares
in it that there is no English gypsy word for &ldquo;green.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
this work he asserts that the English gypsy speech does not probably amount
to fourteen hundred words.&nbsp; It is a weakness with the Romany rye
fraternity to believe that there are no words in gypsy which they to not
know.&nbsp; I am sure that my own collection contains nearly four thousand
Anglo-Romany terms, many of which I feared were doubtful, but which I am
constantly verifying.&nbsp; <!-- page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>America is a far better place in which to
study the language than England.&nbsp; As an old Scotch gypsy said to me
lately, the deepest and cleverest old gypsies all come over here to
America, where they have grown rich, and built the old language up
again.</p>
<p>I knew a gentleman in London who was a man of extraordinary
energy.&nbsp; Having been utterly ruined, at seventy years of age, by a
relative, he left England, was absent two or three years in a foreign
country, during which time he made in business some fifty thousand pounds,
and, returning, settled down in England.&nbsp; He had been in youth for a
long time the most intimate friend of George Borrow, who was, he said, a
very wild and eccentric youth.&nbsp; One night, when skylarking about
London, Borrow was pursued by the police, as he wished to be, even as
Panurge so planned as to be chased by the night-watch.&nbsp; He was very
tall and strong in those days, a trained shoulder-hitter, and could run
like a deer.&nbsp; He was hunted to the Thames, &ldquo;and there they
thought they had him.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the Romany rye made for the edge,
and, leaping into the wan water, like the Squyre in the old ballad, swam to
the other side, and escaped.</p>
<p>I have conversed with Mr. Borrow on many subjects,&mdash;horses,
gypsies, and Old Irish.&nbsp; Anent which latter subject I have heard him
declare that he doubted whether there was any man living who could really
read an old Irish manuscript.&nbsp; I have seen the same statement made by
another writer.&nbsp; My personal impressions of Mr. Borrow were very
agreeable, and I was pleased to learn afterwards from Mrs. Lewis that he
had expressed himself warmly as regarded myself.&nbsp; As he was not
invariably disposed to like those whom be met, it is a source of great
pleasure to me to <!-- page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>reflect that I have nothing but pleasant
memories of the good old Romany rye, the Nestor of gypsy gentlemen.&nbsp;
It is commonly reported among gypsies that Mr. Borrow was one by blood, and
that his real name was Boro, or great.&nbsp; This is not true.&nbsp; He was
of pure English extraction.</p>
<p>When I first met &ldquo;George Eliot&rdquo; and G. H. Lewes, at their
house in North Bank, the lady turned the conversation almost at once to
gypsies.&nbsp; They spoke of having visited the Zincali in Spain, and of
several very curious meetings with the <i>Chabos</i>.&nbsp; Mr. Lewes, in
fact, seldom met me&mdash;and we met very often about town, and at many
places, especially at the Tr&uuml;bners&rsquo;&mdash;without conversing on
the Romanys.&nbsp; The subject evidently had for him a special
fascination.&nbsp; I believe that I have elsewhere mentioned that after I
returned from Russia, and had given him, by particular request, an account
of my visits to the gypsies of St. Petersburg and Moscow, he was much
struck by the fact that I had chiromanced to the Romany clan of the latter
city.&nbsp; To tell the fortunes of gypsy girls was, he thought, the
refinement of presumption.&nbsp; &ldquo;There was in this world nothing so
impudent as a gypsy when determined to tell a fortune; and the idea of not
one, but many gypsy girls believing earnestly in my palmistry was like a
righteous retribution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The late Tom Taylor had, while a student at Cambridge, been
<i>aficionado</i>, or smitten, with gypsies, and made a manuscript
vocabulary of Romany words, which he allowed me to use, and from which I
obtained several which were new to me.&nbsp; This fact should make all
smart gypsy scholars &ldquo;take tent&rdquo; and heed as to believing that
they know everything.&nbsp; <!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>I have many Anglo-Romany words&mdash;purely
Hindi as to origin&mdash;which I have verified again and again, yet which
have never appeared in print.&nbsp; Thus far the Romany vocabulary field
has been merely scratched over.</p>
<p>Who that knows London knoweth not Sir Patrick Colquhoun?&nbsp; I made
his acquaintance in 1848, when, coming over from student-life in Paris and
the Revolution, I was most kindly treated by his family.&nbsp; A glorious,
tough, widely experienced man he was even in early youth.&nbsp; For then he
already bore the enviable reputation of being the first amateur sculler on
the Thames, the first gentleman light-weight boxer in England, a graduate
with honors of Cambridge, a Doctor Ph. of Heidelberg, a diplomat, and a
linguist who knew Arabic, Persian, and Gaelic, Modern Greek and the Omnium
Botherum tongues.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t make such men nowadays, or, if
they do, they leave out the genial element.</p>
<p>Years had passed, and I had returned to London in 1870, and found Sir
Patrick living, as of yore, in the Temple, where I once and yet again and
again dined with him.&nbsp; It was in the early days of this new spring of
English life that we found ourselves by chance at a boat-race on the
Thames.&nbsp; It was on the Thames, by his invitation, that I had twenty
years before first seen an English regatta, and had a place in the gayly
decked, superbly luncheoned barge of his club.&nbsp; It is a curious point
in English character that the cleverest people do not realize or understand
how festive and genial they really are, or how gayly and picturesquely they
conduct their sports.&nbsp; It is a generally accepted doctrine with them
that they do this kind of thing better in France; they believe sincerely
<!-- page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>that they take their own amusements sadly; it is the tone, the
style, with the wearily-witty, dreary clowns of the weekly press, in their
watery imitations of Thackeray&rsquo;s worst, to ridicule all English
festivity and merry-making, as though sunshine had faded out of life, and
God and Nature were dead, and in their place a great wind-bag
Jesuit-Mallock were crying, in tones tainted with sulphuretted hydrogen,
&ldquo;<i>Ah bah</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Reader mine, I have seen many a
f&ecirc;te in my time, all the way from illuminations of Paris to the
Khedive&rsquo;s fifteen-million-dollar spree in 1873 and the last grand
flash of the Roman-candle carnival of 1846, but for true, hearty enjoyment
and quiet beauty give me a merry party on the Thames.&nbsp; Give me, I say,
its sparkling waters, its green banks, the joyous, beautiful girls, the
hearty, handsome men.&nbsp; Give me the boats, darting like fishes, the gay
cries.&nbsp; And oh&mdash;oh!&mdash;give me the Alsopp&rsquo;s ale in a
quart mug, and not a remark save of approbation when I empty it.</p>
<p>I had met Sir Patrick in the crowd, and our conversation turned on
gypsies.&nbsp; When living before-time in Roumania, he had Romany servants,
and learned a little of their language.&nbsp; Yes, he was inclined to be
&ldquo;affected&rdquo; into the race, and thereupon we went gypsying.&nbsp;
Truly, we had not far to seek, for just outside the crowd a large and
flourishing community of the black-blood had set itself up in the
<i>pivlioi</i> (cocoa-nut) or <i>kashta</i> (stick) business, and as it was
late in the afternoon, and the entire business-world was about as drunk as
mere beer could make it, the scene was not unlively.&nbsp; At that time I
was new to England, and unknown to every gypsy on the ground.&nbsp; In
after-days I learned to know them well, very well, for they were chiefly
Coopers and their congeners, <!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>who came to speak of me as <i>their</i> rye
and own special property or proprietor,&mdash;an allegiance which involved
on one side an amount of shillings and beer which concentrated might have
set up a charity, but which was duly reciprocated on the other by jocular
tenures of cocoa-nuts, baskets, and choice and deep words in the language
of Egypt.</p>
<p>As we approached the cock-shy, where sticks were cast at cocoa-nuts, a
young gypsy <i>chai</i>, whom I learned to know in after-days as Athalia
Cooper, asked me to buy some sticks.&nbsp; A penny a throw, all the
cocoa-nuts I could hit to be my own.&nbsp; I declined; she became urgent,
jolly, riotous, insistive.&nbsp; I endured it well, for I held the winning
cards.&nbsp; <i>Qui minus prop&#277;r&egrave;</i>, <i>minus
prosp&#277;r&egrave;</i>.&nbsp; And then, as her voice rose
<i>crescendo</i> into a bawl, so that all the Romanys around laughed aloud
to see the green Gorgio so chaffed and bothered, I bent me low, and
whispered softly in her ear a single monosyllable.</p>
<p>Why are all those sticks dropped so suddenly?&nbsp; Why does Athalia in
a second become sober, and stand up staring at me, all her chaff and
urgency forgotten.&nbsp; Quite polite and earnest now.&nbsp; But there is
joy behind in her heart.&nbsp; This <i>is</i> a game, a jolly game, and no
mistake.&nbsp; And uplifting her voice again, as the voice of one who
findeth an exceeding great treasure even in the wilderness, she cried
aloud,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>It&rsquo;s a Romany rye</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spiciest and saltest and rosiest of Sir Patrick&rsquo;s own stories,
told after dinner over his own old port to a special conventicle of
clergymen about town, was never received with such a roar of delight as
that cry of Athalia&rsquo;s was by the Romany clan.&nbsp; Up went three
sheers at the find; further afield went the shout proclaiming <!-- page
185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>the
discovery of an aristocratic stranger of their race, a <i>rye</i>, who was
to them as wheat,&mdash;a gypsy gentleman.&nbsp; Neglecting business, they
threw down their sticks, and left their cocoanuts to grin in solitude; the
<i>dyes</i> turned aside from fortune-telling to see what strange fortune
had sent such a visitor.&nbsp; In ten minutes Sir Patrick and I were
surrounded by such a circle of sudden admirers and vehement applauders, as
it seldom happens to any mortal to acquire&mdash;out of Ireland&mdash;at
such exceedingly short notice and on such easy terms.</p>
<p>They were not particular as to what sort of a gypsy I was, or where I
came from, or any nonsense of that sort, you know.&nbsp; It was about
<i>cerevisia vincit omnia</i>, or the beery time of day with them, and they
cared not for anything.&nbsp; I was extremely welcome; in short, there was
poetry in me.&nbsp; I had come down on them by a way that was dark and a
trick that was vain, in the path of mystery, and dropped on Athalia and
picked her up.&nbsp; It was gypsily done and very creditable to me, and
even Sir Patrick was regarded as one to be honored as an accomplice.&nbsp;
It is a charming novelty in every life to have the better class of
one&rsquo;s own kind come into it, and nobody feels so keenly as a jolly
Romany that <i>jucundum nihil est nisi quod r&#277;f &#464;cit
varietas</i>&mdash;naught pleases us without variety.</p>
<p>Then and there I drew to me the first threads of what became in
after-days a strange and varied skein of humanity.&nbsp; There was the
Thames upon a holiday.&nbsp; Now I look back to it, I ask, <i>Ubi
sunt</i>?&nbsp; (Where are they all?)&nbsp; Joshua Cooper, as good and
earnest a Rom as ever lived, in his grave, with more than one of those who
made my acquaintance by hurrahing for <!-- page 186--><a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>me.&nbsp; Some in
America, some wandering wide.&nbsp; Yet there by Weybridge still the Thames
runs on.</p>
<p>By that sweet river I made many a song.&nbsp; One of these, to the tune
of &ldquo;Waves in Sunlight Dancing,&rdquo; rises and falls in memory like
a fitful fairy coming and going in green shadows, and that it may not
perish utterly I here give it a place:&mdash;</p>

189</span>WELSH GYPSIES.</h2>
<h3>I.&nbsp; MAT WOODS THE FIDDLER.</h3>
<p>The gypsies of Wales are to those of England what the Welsh themselves
are to the English; more antique and quaint, therefore to a collector of
human bric-a-brac more curious.&nbsp; The Welsh Rom is specially grateful
for kindness or courtesy; he is deeper as to language, and preserves many
of the picturesque traits of his race which are now so rapidly
vanishing.&nbsp; But then he has such excellent opportunity for
gypsying.&nbsp; In Wales there are yet thousands of acres of wild land,
deep ravines, rocky corners, and roadside nooks, where he can boil the
kettle and <i>hatch the tan</i>, or pitch his tent, undisturbed by the
rural policeman.&nbsp; For it is a charming country, where no one need
weary in summer, when the days are long, or in early autumn,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When the barley is ripe,<br />
And the frog doth pipe,<br />
In golden stripe<br />
And green all dressed;<br />
When the red apples<br />
Roll in the chest.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then it is pleasant walking in Wales, and there too at times, between
hedge-rows, you may meet with the Romany.</p>
<p><!-- page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>I was at Aberystwith by the sea, and one afternoon we went, a
party of three gentlemen and three ladies, in a char-a-banc, or wagonette,
to drive.&nbsp; It was a pleasant afternoon, and we had many a fine view of
distant mountains, on whose sides were mines of lead with silver, and of
which there were legends from the time of Queen Elizabeth.&nbsp; The hills
looked leaden and blue in the distance, while the glancing sea far beyond
recalled silver,&mdash;for the alchemy of imagery, at least, is never
wanting to supply ideal metals, though the real may show a sad
<i>deficit</i> in the returns.</p>
<p>As we drove we suddenly overtook a singular party, the first of whom was
the leader, who had lagged behind.&nbsp; He was a handsome, slender, very
dark young man, carrying a violin.&nbsp; Before him went a little open
cart, in which lay an old woman, and by her a harp.&nbsp; With it walked a
good-looking gypsy girl, and another young man, not a gypsy.&nbsp; He was
by far the handsomest young fellow, in form and features, whom I ever met
among the agricultural class in England; we called him a peasant
Apollo.&nbsp; It became evident that the passional affinity which had drawn
this rustic to the gypsy girl, and to the roads, was according to the law
of natural selection, for they were wonderfully well matched.&nbsp; The
young man had the grace inseparable from a fine figure and a handsome face,
while the girl was tall, lithe, and pantherine, with the diavolesque charm
which, though often attributed by fast-fashionable novelists to their
heroines, is really never found except among the lowborn beauties of
nature.&nbsp; It is the beauty of the Imp and of the Serpent; it fades with
letters; it dies in the drawing-room or on the stage.&nbsp; You are
mistaken <!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>when you think you see it coming out of the synagogue, unless it
be a very vulgar one.&nbsp; Your Lahova has it not, despite her black eyes,
for she is too clever and too conscious; the devil-beauty never knows how
to read, she is unstudied and no actress.&nbsp; Rachel and the Bernhardt
have it not, any more than Saint Agnes or Miss Blanche Lapin.&nbsp; It is
not of good or of evil, or of culture, which is both; it is all and only of
nature, and it does not know itself.</p>
<p>As the wagonette stopped I greeted the young man at first in English,
then in Romany.&nbsp; When he heard the gypsy tongue he started, his
countenance expressing the utmost surprise and delight.&nbsp; As if he
could hardly believe in such a phenomenon he inquired,
&ldquo;<i>Romany</i>?&rdquo; and as I nodded assent, he clasped my hand,
the tears coming into his eyes.&nbsp; Such manifestations are not common
among gypsies, but I can remember how one, the wife of black Ben Lee, was
thus surprised and affected.&nbsp; How well I recall the time and
scene,&mdash;by the Thames, in the late twilight, when every tree and twig
was violet black against the amber sky, where the birds were
chirp-chattering themselves to roost and rest, and the river rippled and
murmured a duet with the evening breeze.&nbsp; I was walking homeward to
Oatlands when I met the tawny Sinaminta, bearing her little stock of
baskets to the tent and van which I had just quitted, and where Ben and his
beautiful little boy were lighting the <i>al fresco</i> fire.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have prayed to see this day!&rdquo; exclaimed the gypsy
woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have so wanted to see the Romany rye of the
Coopers.&nbsp; And I laid by a little <i>delaben</i>, a small present, for
you when we should meet.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a photograph of Ben and me and
our child.&rdquo;&nbsp; I might have forgotten the evening <!-- page
192--><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>and the
amber sky, rippling river and dark-green hedge-rows, but for this strange
meeting and greeting of an unknown friend, but a few kind words fixed them
all for life.&nbsp; That must be indeed a wonderful landscape which
humanity does not make more impressive.</p>
<p>I spoke but a few words to the gypsy with the violin, and we drove on to
a little wayside inn, where we alighted and rested.&nbsp; After a while the
gypsies came along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, if you will, let us have a real frolic,&rdquo; I said to
my friends.&nbsp; A word was enough.&nbsp; A quart of ale, and the fiddle
was set going, and I sang in Romany, and the rustic landlord and his
household wondered what sort of guests we could be.&nbsp; That they had
never before entertained such a mixed party I can well believe.&nbsp; Here,
on one hand, were indubitable swells, above their usual range; there, on
the other, were the dusky vagabonds of the road; and it could be no common
condescending patronage, for I was speaking neither Welsh nor English, and
our friendly fraternity was evident.&nbsp; Yes, many a time, in England,
have I seen the civil landlady or the neat-handed Phillis awed with
bewilderment, as I have introduced Plato Buckland, or the most
disreputable-looking but oily&mdash;yea, glycerine-politeful&mdash;old
Windsor Frog, into the parlor, and conversed with him in mystic
words.&nbsp; Such an event is a rare joy to the gypsy.&nbsp; For he loves
to be lifted up among men; he will tell you with pride of the times when he
was pointed at, and people said, &ldquo;<i>He&rsquo;s</i> the man!&rdquo;
and how a real gentleman once invited him into his house and gave him a
glass of wine.&nbsp; But to enter the best room of the familiar tavern, to
order, in politest but <!-- page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>imperative tones,
&ldquo;beer&rdquo;&mdash;sixpenny beer&mdash;for himself and &ldquo;the
other gentleman,&rdquo; is indeed bliss.&nbsp; Then, in addition to the
honor of moving in distinguished society, before the very eyes and in the
high places of those who have hitherto always considered him as a lowly
cuss, the Romany realizes far more than the common peasant the
contrast-contradiction, or the humor of the drama, its bit of
mystification, and especially the mystification of the house-folk.&nbsp;
This is unto him the high hour of the soul, and it is not forgotten.&nbsp;
It passes unto the golden legends of the heart, and you are tenderly
enshrined in it.</p>
<p>Once, when I was wandering afoot with old Cooper, we stopped at an inn,
and in a room by ourselves ordered luncheon.&nbsp; The gypsy might have had
poultry of the best; he preferred cold pork.&nbsp; While the attendant was
in the room, he sat with exemplary dignity at the table; but as the girl
left, he followed her step sounds with his ears, like a dog, moved his
head, glanced at me with a nod, turned sideways from the table, and,
putting his plate on his knees, proceeded to eat without a fork.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For it isn&rsquo;t proper for me to eat at the table with you, or
<i>as</i> you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Welsh gypsy played well, and his sister touched the harp and sang,
the ale circulated, and the villagers, assembling, gazed in a crowd into
the hall.&nbsp; Then the girl danced solo, just as I have seen her sisters
do in Egypt and in Russia, to her brother&rsquo;s fiddling.&nbsp; Even so
of old, Syrian and Egyptian girls haunted gardens and taverns, and danced
<i>pas seul</i> all over the Roman empire, even unto Spain, behaving so
gypsily that wise men have conjectured that they were gypsies in very
truth.&nbsp; And who shall say they were not?&nbsp; For it is <!-- page
194--><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>possible
that prehistorically, and beyond all records of Persian Luri and Syrian
Ballerine and Egyptian Almeh, there was all over the East an outflowing of
these children of art from one common primeval Indian stock.&nbsp; From one
fraternity, in Italy, at the present day, those itinerant pests, the
hand-organ players, proceed to the ends of the earth and to the
gold-diggings thereof, and time will yet show that before all time, or in
its early dawn, there were root-born Romany itinerants singing, piping, and
dancing unto all the known world; yea, and into the unknown darkness
beyond, <i>in partibus infidelium</i>.</p>
<p>A gentleman who was in our party had been long in the East.&nbsp; I had
known him in Alexandria during the carnival, and he had lived long time
<i>outre mer</i>, in India.&nbsp; Hearing me use the gypsy
numerals&mdash;<i>yeck</i>, <i>dui</i>, <i>trin</i>, <i>shtor</i>,
<i>panj</i>,&mdash;he proceeded to count in Hindustani or Persian, in which
the same words from one to ten are almost identical with Romany.&nbsp; All
of this was carefully noted by the old gypsy mother,&mdash;as, also, that
my friend is of dark complexion, with sparkling black eyes.&nbsp; Reduced
in dress, or diluted down to worn corduroy and a red tie, he might easily
pass muster, among the Sons of the Road, as one of them.</p>
<p>And now the ladies must, of course, have their fortunes told, and this,
I could observe, greatly astonished the gypsies in their secret souls,
though they put a cool face on it.&nbsp; That we, ourselves, were some kind
of a mysterious high-caste Romany they had already concluded, and what
faith could we put in <i>dukkerin</i>?&nbsp; But as it would indubitably
bring forth shillings to their benefit, they wisely raised no questions,
but calmly took this windfall, which had fallen <!-- page 195--><a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>as it were, from the
skies, even as they had accepted the beer, which had come, like a
providential rain, unto them, in the thirst of a dry journey.</p>
<p>It is customary for all gypsy sorceresses to take those who are to be
fortune-told aside, and, if possible, into a room by themselves.&nbsp; This
is done partly to enhance the mystery of the proceeding, and partly to
avoid the presence of witnesses to what is really an illegal act.&nbsp; And
as the old sorceress led a lady into the little parlor, the gypsy man,
whose name was Mat, glanced up at me, with a droll, puzzled expression, and
said, &ldquo;Patchessa <i>tu</i> adovo?&rdquo;&nbsp; (Do <i>you</i> believe
in that?)&nbsp; With a wink, I answered, &ldquo;Why not?&nbsp; I, too, tell
fortunes myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Anch io sono pittore</i>.&nbsp; It seemed
to satisfy him, for he replied, with a nod-wink, and proceeded to pour
forth the balance of his thoughts, if he had any, into the music of his
violin.</p>
<p>When the ladies had all been instructed as to their future, my friend,
who had been in the East, must needs have his destiny made known unto
him.&nbsp; He did not believe in this sort of thing, you know,&mdash;of
course not.&nbsp; But he had lived a long time among Orientals, and he just
happened to wish to know how certain speculations would fall out, and he
loves, above all things, a lark, or anything out of the common.&nbsp; So he
went in.&nbsp; And when alone with the sybil, she began to talk to him in
Romany.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say, now, old lady, stow that!&rdquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand me!&rdquo; exclaimed the
fortune-teller.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps you didn&rsquo;t understand your own
mother when she talked Romany to you.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the use of your
tryin&rsquo; to make yourself out a Gorgio <!-- page 196--><a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>to <i>me</i>?&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t I know our people?&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t your friend there talk
Romanes?&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t he all Romaneskas?&nbsp; And didn&rsquo;t I hear
you with my own ears count up to ten in Romany?&nbsp; And now, after that,
you would deny your own blood and people!&nbsp; Yes, you&rsquo;ve dwelt in
Gorgines so long that you think your eyes are blue and your hair is yellow,
my son, and you have been far over the sea; but wherever you went you knew
Romanes, if you don&rsquo;t know your own color.&nbsp; But you shall hear
your fortune.&nbsp; There is lead in the mines and silver in the lead, and
wealth for him who is to win it, and that will be a dark man who has been
nine times over the sea, and eaten his bread under the black tents, and
been three times near death, once from a horse, and once from a man, and
once through a woman.&nbsp; And you will know something you don&rsquo;t
know now before a month is over, and something will be found that is now
hidden, and has been hidden since the world was made.&nbsp; And
there&rsquo;s a good fortune coming to the man it was made for, before the
oldest tree that&rsquo;s a-growing was a seed, and that&rsquo;s a man as
knows how to count Romanes up to ten, and many a more thing beside that,
that he&rsquo;s learned beyond the great water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so we went our ways, the harp and violin sounds growing fainter as
we receded, till they were like the buzzing of bees in drying clover, and
the twilight grew rosier brown.&nbsp; I never met Mat Woods again, though I
often heard of his fame as a fiddler.&nbsp; Whether my Anglo-Indian friend
found the fortune so vaguely predicted is to me as yet unknown.&nbsp; But I
believe that the prediction encouraged him.&nbsp; That there are evils in
palmistry, and sin in card-drawing, and iniquity in coffee-grounding, and
vice in all the <!-- page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>planets, is established by statute, and yet
withal I incline to believe that the art of prediction cheers up many a
despondent soul, and does some little good, even as good ale, despite the
wickedness of drinking, makes some hearts merry and others stronger.&nbsp;
If there are foolish maids who have had their heads turned by being told of
coming noblemen and prospective swells, who loved the ground they trod on,
and were waiting to woo and win and wed, and if the same maidens herein
described have thereby, in the manner set forth, been led by the aforesaid
devices unto their great injury, as written in the above indictment, it may
also <i>per contra</i> and on the other hand be pleaded that divers girls,
to wit, those who believe in prediction, have, by encouragement and hope to
them held out of legally marrying sundry young men of good estate, been
induced to behave better than they would otherwise have done, and led by
this hope have acted more morally than was their wont, and thereby lifted
themselves above the lowly state of vulgarity, and even of vice, in which
they would otherwise have groveled, hoveled, or cottaged.&nbsp; And there
have been men who, cherishing in their hearts a prediction, or, what
amounts to the same thing, a conviction, or a set fancy, have persevered in
hope until the hope was realized.&nbsp; You, O Christian, who believe in a
millennium, you, O Jew, who expect a Messiah, and await the fulfillment of
your <i>dukkerin</i>, are both in the right, for both will come true when
you <i>make</i> them do so.</p>

198</span>II.&nbsp; THE PIOUS WASHERWOMAN.</h3>
<p>There is not much in life pleasanter than a long ramble on the road in
leaf-green, sun-gold summer.&nbsp; Then it is Nature&rsquo;s merry-time,
when fowls in woods them maken blithe, and the crow preaches from the fence
to his friends afield, and the honeysuckle winketh to the wild rose in the
hedge when she is wooed by the little buzzy bee.&nbsp; In such times it is
good for the heart to wander over the hills and far away, into haunts known
of old, where perhaps some semi-Saxon church nestles in a hollow behind a
hill, where grass o&rsquo;ergrows each mouldering tomb, and the brook, as
it ripples by in a darksome aldered hollow, speaks in a language which man
knows no more, but which is answered in the same forgotten tongue by the
thousand-year yew as it rustles in the breeze.&nbsp; And when there are
Runic stones in this garden of God, where He raises souls, I often fancy
that this old dialect is written in their rhythmic lines.&nbsp; The
yew-trees were planted by law, lang-syne, to yield bows to the realm, and
now archery is dead and Martini-Henry has taken its place, but the yews
still live, and the Runic fine art of the twisted lines on the tombs, after
a thousand years&rsquo; sleep, is beginning to revive.&nbsp; Every thing at
such a time speaks of joy and resurrection&mdash;tree and tomb and bird and
flower and bee.</p>
<p>These are all memories of a walk from the town <!-- page 199--><a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>of Aberystwith, in
Wales, which walk leads by an ancient church, in the soul garden of which
are two Runic cross tombstones.&nbsp; One day I went farther afield to a
more ancient shrine, on the top of a high mountain.&nbsp; This was to the
summit of Cader Idris, sixteen miles off.&nbsp; On this summit there is a
Druidical circle, of which the stones, themselves to ruin grown, are
strange and death-like old.&nbsp; Legend says that this is the burial-place
of Taliesin, the first of Welsh bards, the primeval poet of Celtic
time.&nbsp; Whoever sleeps on the grave will awake either a madman or a
poet, or is at any rate unsafe to become one or the other.&nbsp; I went,
with two friends, afoot on this little pilgrimage.&nbsp; Both were
professors at one of the great universities.&nbsp; The elder is a gentleman
of great benevolence, learning, and gentleness; the other, a younger man,
has been well polished and sharpened by travel in many lands.&nbsp; It is
rumored that he has preached Islam in a mosque unto the Moslem even unto
taking up a collection, which is the final test of the faith which reaches
forth into a bright eternity.&nbsp; That he can be, as I have elsewhere
noted, a Persian unto Persians, and a Romany among Roms, and a professional
among the hanky-pankorites, is likewise on the cards, as surely as that he
knows the roads and all the devices and little games of them that dwell
thereon.&nbsp; Though elegant enough in his court dress and rapier when he
kisses the hand of our sovereign lady the queen, he appears such an
abandoned rough when he goes a-fishing that the innocent and guileless
gypsies, little suspecting that a <i>rye</i> lies <i>perdu</i> in his
wrap-rascal, will then confide in him as if he and in-doors had never been
acquainted.</p>
<p>We had taken with us a sparing lunch of thin <!-- page 200--><a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>sandwiches and a
frugal flask of modest, blushing brandy, which we diluted at a stingy
little fountain spring which dropped economically through a rift in the
rock, as if its nymph were conscious that such a delicious drink should not
be wasted.&nbsp; As it was, it refreshed us, and we were resting in a
blessed repose under the green leaves, when we heard footsteps, and an old
woman came walking by.</p>
<p>She was the ideal of decent and extreme poverty.&nbsp; I never saw
anybody who was at once so poor and so clean.&nbsp; In her face and in her
thin garments was marked the mute, resolute struggle between need and
self-respect, which, to him who understands it, is as brave as any battle
between life and death.&nbsp; She walked on as if she would have gone past
without a word, but when we greeted her she paused, and spoke
respectfully.&nbsp; Without forwardness she told her sad and simple story:
how she belonged to the Wesleyan confession, how her daughter was dying in
the hospital at Caernarvon; how she had walked sixty miles to see her, and
hoped to get there in time to close her eyes.&nbsp; In reply to a question
as to her means, she admitted that they were exhausted, but that she could
get through without money; she did not beg.&nbsp; And then came naturally
enough the rest of the little artless narrative, as it generally happens
among the simple annals of the poor: how she had been for forty years a
washerwoman, and had a letter from her clergyman.</p>
<p>There was a tear in the eye of the elder professor, and his hand was in
his pocket.&nbsp; The younger smoked in silence.&nbsp; I was greatly moved
myself,&mdash;perhaps bewildered would be the better word,&mdash;when, all
at once, as the old woman turned in the sunlight, I caught the expression
<i>of the corner of an eye</i>!</p>
<p><!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>My friend Salaman, who boasts that he is of the last of the
Sadducees,&mdash;that strange, ancient, and secret sect, who disguise
themselves as the <i>Neu Reformirte</i>,&mdash;declares that the Sephardim
may be distinguished from the Ashkenazim as readily as from the confounded
Goyim, by the corners of their eyes.&nbsp; This he illustrated by pointing
out to me, as they walked by in the cool of the evening, the difference
between the eyes of Fraulein Eleonora Kohn and Senorita Linda Abarbanel and
divers and sundry other young ladies,&mdash;the result being that I
received in return thirty-six distinct <i>&oelig;illades</i>, several of
which expressed indignation, and in all of which there was evidently an
entire misconception of my object in looking at them.&nbsp; Now the eyes of
the Sephardesses are unquestionably fascinating; and here it may be
recalled that, in the Middle Ages, witches were also recognized by having
exactly the same corners, or peaks, to the eye.&nbsp; This is an ancient
mystery of darksome lore, that the enchantress always has the bird-peaked
eye, which betokens danger to somebody, be she of the Sephardim, or an
ordinary witch or enchantress, or a gypsy.</p>
<p>Now, as the old Wesleyan washerwoman turned around in the sunshine, I
saw the witch-pointed eye and the glint of the Romany.&nbsp; And then I
glanced at her hands, and saw that they had not been long familiar with
wash-tubs; for, though clean, they were brown, and had never been blanched
with an age of soap-suds.&nbsp; And I spoke suddenly, and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Can tute rakker Romanes</i>, <i>miri dye</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp;
(Can you speak Romany, my mother?)&nbsp; And she answered, as if
bewildered,&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>&ldquo;The Lord forbid, sir, that I should talk any of them
wicked languages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger professor&rsquo;s eyes expressed dawning delight.&nbsp; I
followed my shot with,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Tute needn&rsquo;t be attrash to rakker</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Mandy&rsquo;s been apr&eacute; the drom mi-kokero</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; (You
needn&rsquo;t be afraid to speak.&nbsp; I have been upon the road
myself.)</p>
<p>And, still more confused, she answered in English,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, sir, you be upon the road now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me, old lady,&rdquo; remarked the younger professor,
&ldquo;that you understand Romany very well for one who has been for forty
years in the Methodist communion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be observed that he here confounded washing with worshiping.</p>
<p>The face of the true believer was at this point a fine study.&nbsp; All
her confidence had deserted her.&nbsp; Whether she thought we were of her
kind in disguise, or that, in the unknown higher world of respectability,
there might be gypsies of corresponding rank, even as there might be gypsy
angels among the celestial hierarchies, I cannot with confidence
assert.&nbsp; About a week ago a philologist and purist told me that there
is no exact synonym in English for the word <i>flabbergasted</i>, as it
expresses a peculiar state of bewilderment as yet unnamed by scholars, and
it exactly sets forth the condition in which our virtuous poverty
appeared.&nbsp; She was, indeed, flabbergasted.&nbsp; <i>Cornix scorpum
rapuit</i>,&mdash;the owl had come down on the rabbits, and lo! they had
fangs.&nbsp; I resumed,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, old lady, here is a penny.&nbsp; You are a very poor person,
and I pity you so much that I give you this penny for your poverty.&nbsp;
But there is a pocketful <!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>where this came from, and you shall have the
lot if you&rsquo;ll <i>rakker</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;that is, talk gypsy.</p>
<p>And at that touch of the Ithuriel spear the old toad flashed up into the
Romany devil, as with gleaming eyes and a witch-like grin she cried in a
mixture of gypsy and tinker languages,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gents, I&rsquo;ll have tute jin when you tharis mandy you rakker
a reg&rsquo;lar fly old bewer.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which means, &ldquo;Gentlemen,
I&rsquo;ll have you know, when you talk to me, you talk to a reg&rsquo;lar
shrewd old female thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The face of the elder professor was a study of astonishment for
Lavater.&nbsp; His fingers relaxed their grasp of the shilling, his hand
was drawn from his pocket, and his glance, like Bill Nye&rsquo;s, remarked:
&ldquo;<i>Can</i> this be?&rdquo;&nbsp; He tells the story to this day, and
always adds, &ldquo;I <i>never</i> was so astonished in my
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the venerable washerwoman was also changed, and, the
mask once thrown aside, she became as festive as a witch on the
Brocken.&nbsp; Truly, it is a great comfort to cease playing a part,
particularly a pious one, and be at home and at ease among your like; and
better still if they be swells.&nbsp; This was the delight of
Anderson&rsquo;s ugly duck when it got among the swans, &ldquo;and, blest
sensation, felt genteel.&rdquo;&nbsp; And to show her gratitude, the
sorceress, who really seemed to have grown several shades darker, insisted
on telling our fortunes.&nbsp; I think it was to give vent to her feelings
in defiance of the law that she did this; certain it was that just then,
under the circumstances, it was the only way available in which the law
could be broken.&nbsp; And as it was, indeed, by heath and hill that the
priestess of the hidden spell bade the Palmer from over the sea hold out
his palm.&nbsp; And she began in the usual sing-song tone, mocking the
style of <!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>gypsy fortune-tellers, and satirizing herself.&nbsp; And thus she
spoke,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re born under a lucky star, my good gentleman, and
you&rsquo;re a married man; but there&rsquo;s a black-eyed young lady
that&rsquo;s in love with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother of all the thieves!&rdquo; I cried,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve put the <i>dukkerin</i> on the wrong man.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m the one that the dark girls go after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my good gentleman.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s in love with you
both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now tell my fortune!&rdquo; I exclaimed, and with a grim
expression, casting up my palm, I said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Pen mengy if mandy&rsquo;ll be bitchad&eacute; p&#257;del for
chorin a gry</i>, <i>or nasherdo for merin a gav-mush</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(Tell me if I am to be transported for stealing a horse, or hung for
killing a policeman.)</p>
<p>The old woman&rsquo;s face changed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never need
to steal a horse.&nbsp; The man that knows what you know never need be poor
like me.&nbsp; I know who <i>you</i> are <i>now</i>; you&rsquo;re not one
of these tourists.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re the boro Romany rye [the tall gypsy
gentleman].&nbsp; And go your way, and brag about it in your
house,&mdash;and well you may,&mdash;that Old Moll of the Roads
couldn&rsquo;t take you in, and that you found her out.&nbsp; Never another
<i>rye</i> but you will ever say that again.&nbsp; Never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she went dancing away in the sunshine, capering backwards along the
road, merrily shaking the pennies in her hand for music, while she sang
something in gypsy,&mdash;witch to the last, vanishing as witches only
can.&nbsp; And there came over me a feeling as of the very olden time, and
some memory of another witch, who had said to another man,
&ldquo;<i>Thou</i> art no traveler, Great master, I know thee now;&rdquo;
<!-- page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>and who, when he called her the mother of the giants, replied,
&ldquo;Go thy way, and boast at home that no man will ever waken me again
with spells.&nbsp; Never.&rdquo;&nbsp; That was the parting of Odin and the
Vala sorceress, and it was the story of oldest time; and so the myth of
ancient days becomes a tattered parody, and thus runs the world away to
Romanys and rags&mdash;when the gods are gone.</p>
<p>When I laughed at the younger professor for confounding forty years in
the church with as many at the wash-tub, he replied,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cleanliness is with me so near to godliness that it is not
remarkable that in my hurry I mistook one for the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we went on and climbed Cader Idris, and found the ancient grave of
rocks in a mystic circle, whose meaning lies buried with the last Druid,
who would perhaps have told you they were&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Seats of stone nevir hewin with mennes hand<br />
But wrocht by Nature as it ane house had bene<br />
For Nymphes, goddis of floudes and woodis grene.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And we saw afar the beautiful scene, &ldquo;where fluddes rynnys in the
foaming sea,&rdquo; as Gawain Douglas sings, and where, between the fresh
water and salt, stands a village, even where it stood in earliest Cymric
prehistoric dawn, and the spot where ran the weir in which the prince who
was in grief because his weir yielded no fish, at last fished up a poet,
even as Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter fished out a prophet.&nbsp; I shall not
soon forget that summer day, nor the dream-like panorama, nor the ancient
grave; nor how the younger professor lay down on the seat of stone nevir
hewin with mennes hand, and declared he had a nap,&mdash;just enough to
make him a poet.&nbsp; To prove which he <!-- page 206--><a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>wrote a long poem on
the finding of Taliesin in the nets, and sent it to the Aberystwith
newspaper; while I, not to be behindhand, wrote another, in imitation of
the triplets of Llydwarch Hen, which were so greatly admired as tributes to
Welsh poetry that they were forthwith translated faithfully into lines of
consonants, touched up with so many <i>w</i>&rsquo;s that they looked like
saws; and they circulated even unto Llandudno, and, for aught I know, may
be sung at Eistedfodds, now and ever, to the twanging of small
harps,&mdash;<i>in s&oelig;cula s&aelig;culorum</i>.&nbsp; Truly, the day
which had begun with a witch ended fitly enough at the tomb of a prophet
poet.</p>
<h3><!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>III.&nbsp; THE GYPSIES AT ABERYSTWITH.</h3>
<p>Aberystwith is a little fishing-village, which has of late years first
bloomed as a railway-station, and then fruited into prosperity as a
bathing-place.&nbsp; Like many <i>parvenus</i>, it makes a great display of
its Norman ancestor, the old castle, saying little about the long centuries
of plebeian obscurity in which it was once buried.&nbsp; This castle, after
being woefully neglected during the days when nobody cared for its early
respectability, has been suddenly remembered, now that better times have
come, and, though not restored, has been made comely with grass banks,
benches, and gravel walks, reminding one of an Irish grandfather in
America, taken out on a Sunday with &ldquo;the childher,&rdquo; and looking
&ldquo;gintale&rdquo; in the clean shirt and whole coat unknown to him for
many a decade in Tipperary.&nbsp; Of course the castle and the wealth, or
the hotels and parade, are well to the fore, or boldly displayed, as
Englishly as possible, while the little Welsh town shrinks quietly into the
hollow behind.&nbsp; And being new to prosperity, Aberystwith is also a
little muddled as to propriety.&nbsp; It would regard with horror the idea
of allowing ladies and gentlemen to bathe together, even though completely
clad; but it sees nothing out of the way when gentlemen in pre-fig-leaf
costume disport themselves, bathing just before the young ladies&rsquo;
boarding-school and the chief <!-- page 208--><a name="page208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>hotel, or running joyous races on the
beach.&nbsp; I shall never forget the amazement and horror with which an
Aberystwithienne learned that in distant lands ladies and gentlemen went
into the water arm in arm, although dressed.&nbsp; But when it was urged
that the Aberystwith system was somewhat peculiar, she replied, &ldquo;Oh,
<i>that</i> is a very different thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On which words for a text a curious sermon might be preached to the
Philistiny souls who live perfectly reconciled to absurd paradoxes, simply
because they are accustomed to them.&nbsp; Now, of all human beings, I
think the gypsies are freest from trouble with paradoxes as to things being
different or alike, and the least afflicted with moral problems, burning
questions, social puzzles, or any other kind of mental rubbish.&nbsp; They
are even freer than savages or the heathen in this respect, since of all
human beings the Fijian, New Zealander, Mpongwe, or Esquimaux is most
terribly tortured with the laws of etiquette, religion, social position,
and propriety.&nbsp; Among many of these heathen unfortunates the meeting
with an equal involves fifteen minutes of bowing, re-bowing, surre-bowing,
and rejoinder-bowing, with complementary complimenting, according to old
custom, while the worship of Mrs. Grundy through a superior requires a half
hour wearisome beyond belief.&nbsp; &ldquo;In Fiji,&rdquo; says Miss C. F.
Gordon Cumming, &ldquo;strict etiquette rules every action of life, and the
most trifling mistake in such matters would cause as great dissatisfaction
as a breach in the order of precedence at a European
ceremonial.&rdquo;&nbsp; In dividing cold baked missionary at a dinner,
especially if a chief be present, the host committing the least mistake as
to helping the proper guest to the proper piece in the proper way would
<!-- page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>find himself promptly put down in the <i>menu</i>.&nbsp; In Fiji,
as in all other countries, this punctilio is nothing but the direct result
of ceaseless effort on the part of the upper classes to distinguish
themselves from the lower.&nbsp; Cannibalism is a joint sprout from the
same root; &ldquo;the devourers of the poor&rdquo; are the scorners of the
humble and lowly, and they are all grains of the same corn, of the
devil&rsquo;s planting, all the world over.&nbsp; Perhaps the quaintest
error which haunts the world in England and America is that so much of this
stuff as is taught by rule or fashion as laws for &ldquo;the
<i>&eacute;lite</i>&rdquo; is the very nucleus of enlightenment and
refinement, instead of its being a remnant of barbarism.&nbsp; And when we
reflect on the degree to which this na&iuml;ve and child-like faith exists
in the United States, as shown by the enormous amount of information in
certain newspapers as to what is the latest thing necessary to be done,
acted, or suffered in order to be socially saved, I surmise that some
future historian will record that we, being an envious people, turned out
the Chinese, because we could not endure the presence among us of a race so
vastly our superiors in all that constituted the true principles of culture
and &ldquo;custom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur Mitchell, in inquiring What is Civilization? <a
name="citation209"></a><a href="#footnote209" class="citation">[209]</a>
remarks that &ldquo;all the things which gather round or grow upon a high
state of civilization are not necessarily true parts of it.&nbsp; These
conventionalities are often regarded as its very essence.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
it is true that the greater the fool or snob, the deeper is the conviction
that the conventional is the core of &ldquo;culture.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;&lsquo;It is not genteel,&rsquo; &lsquo;in good form,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;the mode,&rsquo; to do this or do that, or say this or say
that.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 210--><a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>&ldquo;Such things are spoken of as marks of a
high civilization, or by those who do not confound civilization with
culture as differentiators between the cultured and the
uncultured.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Mitchell &ldquo;neither praises nor condemns
these things;&rdquo; but it is well for a man, while he is about it, to
know his own mind, and I, for myself, condemn them with all my heart and
soul, whenever anybody declares that such brass counters in the game of
life are real gold, and insists that I shall accept them as such.&nbsp; For
small play in a very small way with small people, I would endure them; but
many men and nearly all women make their capital of them.&nbsp; And
whatever may be said in their favor, it cannot be denied that they
constantly lead to lying and heartlessness.&nbsp; Even Dr. Mitchell, while
he says he does not condemn them, proceeds immediately to declare that
&ldquo;while we submit to them they constitute a sort of tyranny, under
which we fret and secretly pine for escape.&nbsp; Does not the exquisite of
Rotten Row weary for his flannel shirt and shooting-jacket?&nbsp; Do not
&lsquo;well-constituted&rsquo; men want to fish and shoot or kill
something, themselves, by climbing mountains, when they can find nothing
else?&nbsp; In short, does it not appear that these conventionalities are
irksome, and are disregarded when the chance presents itself?&nbsp; And
does it not seem as if there were something in human nature pulling men
back to a rude and simple life?&rdquo;&nbsp; To find that <i>men</i> suffer
under the conventionalities, &ldquo;adds, on the whole,&rdquo; says our
canny, prudent Scot, &ldquo;to the respectability of human
nature.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Tu ha ragione</i> (right you are), Dr. Mitchell,
there.&nbsp; For the conventional, whether found among Fijians as they
were, or in Mayfair as it is, whenever it is vexatious and merely serves as
a <!-- page 211--><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>cordon to separate &ldquo;sassiety&rdquo; from society, detracts
from the respectability of humanity, and is in itself vulgar.&nbsp; If
every man in society were a gentleman and every woman a lady, there would
be no more conventionalism.&nbsp; <i>Usus est tyrannus</i> (custom is a
tyrant), or, as the Talmud proverb saith, &ldquo;Custom is the plague of
wise men, but is the idol of fools.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he was a wise Jew,
whoever he was, who declared it.</p>
<p>But let us return to our black sheep, the gypsy.&nbsp; While happy in
not being conventional, and while rejoicing, or at least unconsciously
enjoying freedom from the bonds of etiquette, he agrees with the Chinese,
red Indians, May Fairies, and Fifth Avenoodles in manifesting under the
most trying circumstances that imperturbability which was once declared by
an eminent Philadelphian to be &ldquo;the Corinthian ornament of a
gentleman.&rdquo;&nbsp; He who said this builded better than he knew, for
the ornament in question, if purely Corinthian, is simply brass.&nbsp; One
morning I was sauntering with the Palmer in Aberystwith, when we met with a
young and good-looking gypsy woman, with whom we entered into conversation,
learning that she was a Bosville, and acquiring other items of news as to
Egypt and the roads, and then left.</p>
<p>We had not gone far before we found a tinker.&nbsp; He who catches a
tinker has got hold of half a gypsy and a whole cosmopolite, however bad
the catch may be.&nbsp; He did not understand the greeting
<i>Sarishan</i>!&mdash;he really could not remember to have heard it.&nbsp;
He did not know any gypsies,&mdash;&ldquo;he could not get along with
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; They were a bad lot.&nbsp; He had seen some gypsies
three weeks before on the road.&nbsp; They were curious dark people, who
lived in tents.&nbsp; He could not talk Romany.</p>
<p><!-- page 212--><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>This was really pitiable.&nbsp; It was too much.&nbsp; The Palmer
informed him that he was wasting his best opportunities, and that it was a
great pity that any man who lived on the roads should be so ignorant.&nbsp;
The tinker never winked.&nbsp; In the goodness of our hearts we even
offered to give him lessons in the <i>kalo jib</i>, or black
language.&nbsp; The grinder was as calm as a Belgravian image.&nbsp; And as
we turned to depart the professor said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mandy&rsquo;d del tute a shahori to pi moro kammaben</i>,
<i>if tute jinned sa mandi pukkers</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; (I&rsquo;d give you a
sixpence to drink our health, if you knew what I am saying.)</p>
<p>With undisturbed gravity the tinker replied,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I come to think of it, I do remember to have heard
somethin&rsquo; in the parst like that.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a conwivial
expression arskin&rsquo; me if I won&rsquo;t have a tanner for ale.&nbsp;
Which I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now since you take such an interest in gypsies,&rdquo; I
answered, &ldquo;it is a pity that you should know so little about
them.&nbsp; I have seen them since you have.&nbsp; I saw a nice young
woman, one of the Bosvilles here, not half an hour ago.&nbsp; Shall I
introduce you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That young woman,&rdquo; remarked the tinker, with the same
immovable countenance, &ldquo;is my wife.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ve come down
here, by app&rsquo;intment, to meet some Romany pals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And having politely accepted his sixpence, the griddler went his way,
tinkling his bell, along the road.&nbsp; He did not disturb himself that
his first speeches did not agree with his last; he was not in the habit of
being disturbed about anything, and he knew that no one ever learned Romany
without learning with it not to be astonished at any little
inconsistencies.&nbsp; Serene <!-- page 213--><a name="page213"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 213</span>and polished as a piece of tin in the
sunshine, he would not stoop to be put out by trifles.&nbsp; He was a
typical tinker.&nbsp; He knew that the world had made up proverbs
expressing the utmost indifference either for a tinker&rsquo;s blessing or
a tinker&rsquo;s curse, and he retaliated by not caring a curse whether the
world blessed or banned him.&nbsp; In all ages and in all lands the tinker
has always been the type of this droning indifference, which goes through
life bagpiping its single melody, or whistling, like the serene Marquis de
Crabs, &ldquo;Toujours Santerre.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Es ist und bleibt das alte Lied<br />
Von dem versoff&rsquo;nen Pfannenschmied,<br />
Und wer&rsquo;s nicht weiter singen kann,<br />
Der fang&rsquo;s von Vorne wieder an.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;T will ever be the same old song<br />
Of tipsy tinkers all day long,<br />
And he who cannot sing it more<br />
May sing it over, as before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I should have liked to know John Bunyan.&nbsp; As a half-blood gypsy
tinker he must have been self-contained and pleasant.&nbsp; He had his wits
about him, too, in a very Romanly way.&nbsp; When confined in prison he
made a flute or pipe out of the leg of his three legged-stool, and would
play on it to pass time.&nbsp; When the jailer entered to stop the noise,
John replaced the leg in the stool, and sat on it looking innocent as only
a gypsy tinker could,&mdash;calm as a summer morning.&nbsp; I commend the
subject for a picture.&nbsp; Very recently, that is, in the beginning of
1881, a man of the same tinkering kind, and possibly of the same blood as
Honest John, confined in the prison of Moyamensing, Philadelphia, did
nearly the same thing, only that instead of making his stool leg into a
musical <!-- page 214--><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>pipe he converted it into a pipe for tobacco.&nbsp; But when the
watchman, led by the smell, entered his cell, there was no pipe to be
found; only a deeply injured man complaining that &ldquo;somebody, had been
smokin&rsquo; outside, and it had blowed into his cell through the
door-winder from the corridore, and p&rsquo;isoned the atmosphere.&nbsp;
And he didn&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thus history repeats
itself.&nbsp; &rsquo;T is all very well for the sticklers for Wesleyan
gentility to deny that John Bunyan was a gypsy, but he who in his life
cannot read Romany between the lines knows not the jib nor the cut
thereof.&nbsp; Tough was J. B., &ldquo;and de-vil-ish sly,&rdquo; and
altogether a much better man than many suppose him to have been.</p>
<p>The tinker lived with his wife in a &ldquo;tramps&rsquo;
lodging-house&rdquo; in the town.&nbsp; To those Americans who know such
places by the abominable dens which are occasionally reported by American
grand juries, the term will suggest something much worse than it is.&nbsp;
In England the average tramp&rsquo;s lodging is cleaner, better regulated,
and more orderly than many Western &ldquo;hotels.&rdquo;&nbsp; The police
look closely after it, and do not allow more than a certain number in a
room.&nbsp; They see that it is frequently cleaned, and that clean sheets
are frequently put on the beds.&nbsp; One or two hand-organs in the hall,
with a tinker&rsquo;s barrow or wheel, proclaimed the character of the
lodgers, and in the sitting-room there were to be found, of an evening,
gypsies, laborers with their families seeking work or itinerant
musicians.&nbsp; I can recall a powerful and tall young man, with a badly
expressive face, one-legged, and well dressed as a sailor.&nbsp; He was a
beggar, who measured the good or evil of all mankind by what they gave
him.&nbsp; He was very bitter as to <!-- page 215--><a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>the bad.&nbsp; Yet
this house was in its way upper class.&nbsp; It was not a den of despair,
dirt, and misery, and even the Italians who came there were obliged to be
decent and clean.&nbsp; It would not have been appropriate to have written
for them on the door, &ldquo;<i>Voi che intrate lasciate ogni
speranza</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; (He who enters here leaves soap behind.)&nbsp;
The most painful fact which struck me, in my many visits, was the
intelligence and decency of some of the boarders.&nbsp; There was more than
one who conversed in a manner which indicated an excellent early education;
more than one who read the newspaper aloud and commented on it to the
company, as any gentleman might have done.&nbsp; Indeed, the painful part
of life as shown among these poor people was the manifest fact that so many
of them had come down from a higher position, or were qualified for
it.&nbsp; And this is characteristic of such places.&nbsp; In his
&ldquo;London Labour and the London Poor,&rdquo; vol. i. p. 217, Mahew
tells of a low lodging-house &ldquo;in which there were at one time five
university men, three surgeons, and several sorts of broken-down
clerks.&rdquo;&nbsp; The majority of these cases are the result of parents
having risen from poverty and raised their families to
&ldquo;gentility.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sons are deprived by their bringing up
of the vulgar pluck and coarse energy by which the father rose, and yet are
expected to make their way in the world, with nothing but a so-called
&ldquo;education,&rdquo; which is too often less a help than a
hindrance.&nbsp; In the race of life no man is so heavily handicapped as a
young &ldquo;gentleman.&rdquo;&nbsp; The humblest and raggedest of all the
inmates of this house were two men who got their living by <i>shelkin
gallopas</i> (or selling ferns), as it is called in the Shelta, or
tinker&rsquo;s and tramp&rsquo;s slang.&nbsp; One of these, whom I <!--
page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>have
described in another chapter as teaching me this dialect, could conjugate a
French verb; we thought he had studied law.&nbsp; The other was a poor old
fellow called Krooty, who could give the Latin names for all the plants
which he gathered and sold, and who would repeat poetry very appropriately,
proving sufficiently that he had read it.&nbsp; Both the fern-sellers spoke
better English than divers Lord Mayors and Knights to whom I have listened,
for they neither omitted <i>h</i> like the lowly, nor <i>r</i> like the
lofty ones of London.</p>
<p>The tinker&rsquo;s wife was afflicted with a nervous disorder, which
caused her great suffering, and made it almost impossible for her to sell
goods, or contribute anything to the joint support.&nbsp; Her husband
always treated her with the greatest kindness; I have seldom seen an
instance in which a man was more indulgent and gentle.&nbsp; He made no
display whatever of his feelings; it was only little by little that I found
out what a heart this imperturbable rough of the road possessed.&nbsp; Now
the Palmer, who was always engaged in some wild act of unconscious
benevolence, bought for her some medicine, and gave her an order on the
first physician in the town for proper advice; the result being a decided
amelioration of her health.&nbsp; And I never knew any human being to be
more sincerely grateful than the tinker was for this kindness.&nbsp;
Ascertaining that I had tools for wood-carving, he insisted on presenting
me with crocus powder, &ldquo;to put an edge on.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had a
remarkably fine whetstone, &ldquo;the best in England; it was worth half a
sovereign,&rdquo; and this he often and vainly begged me to accept.&nbsp;
And he had a peculiar little trick of relieving his kindly feelings.&nbsp;
Whenever we dropped in of an <!-- page 217--><a name="page217"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>evening to the lodging-house, he would
cunningly borrow my knife, and then disappear.&nbsp; Presently the
<i>whiz-whiz</i>, <i>st&rsquo;st</i> of his wheel would be heard without,
and then the artful dodger would reappear with a triumphant smile, and with
the knife sharpened to a razor edge.&nbsp; Anent which gratitude I shall
have more to say anon.</p>
<p>One day I was walking on the Front, when I overtook a gypsy van, loaded
with baskets and mats, lumbering along.&nbsp; The proprietor, who was a
stranger to me, was also slightly or lightly lumbering in his gait, being
cheerfully beery, while his berry brown wife, with a little three-year-old
boy, peddled wares from door to door.&nbsp; Both were amazed and pleased at
being accosted in Romany.&nbsp; In the course of conversation they showed
great anxiety as to their child, who had long suffered from some disorder
which caused them great alarm.&nbsp; The man&rsquo;s first name was Anselo,
though it was painted Onslow on his vehicle.&nbsp; Mr. Anselo, though
himself just come to town, was at once deeply impressed with the duty of
hospitality to a Romany rye.&nbsp; I had called him <i>pal</i>, and this in
gypsydom involves the shaking of hands, and with the better class an extra
display of courtesy.&nbsp; He produced half a crown, and declared his
willingness to devote it all to beer for my benefit.&nbsp; I declined, but
he repeated his offer several times,&mdash;not with any annoying display,
but with a courteous earnestness, intended to set forth a sweet
sincerity.&nbsp; As I bade him good-by, he put the crown-piece into one
eye, and as he danced backward, gypsy fashion up the street and vanished in
the sunny purple twilight towards the sea I could see him winking with the
other, and hear him cry, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say no&mdash;now&rsquo;s the
last chance&mdash;do I hear a bid?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>We found this family in due time at the lodging-house, where the
little boy proved to be indeed seriously ill, and we at once discovered
that the parents, in their ignorance, had quite misunderstood his malady
and were aggravating it by mal-treatment.&nbsp; To these poor people the
good Palmer also gave an order on the old physician, who declared that the
boy must have died in a few days, had he not taken charge of him.&nbsp; As
it was, the little fellow was speedily cured.&nbsp; There was, it appeared,
some kind of consanguinity between the tinker or his wife and the Anselo
family.&nbsp; These good people, anxious to do anything, yet able to do
little, consulted together as to showing their gratitude, and noting that
we were specially desirous of collecting old gypsy words gave us all they
could think of, and without informing us of their intention, which indeed
we only learned by accident a long time after, sent a messenger many miles
to bring to Aberystwith a certain Bosville, who was famed as being deep in
Romany lore, and in possession of many ancient words.&nbsp; Which was
indeed true, he having been the first to teach us <i>pis&#257;li</i>,
meaning a saddle, and in which Professor Cowell, of Cambridge, promptly
detected the Sanskrit for sit-upon, the same double meaning also existing
in <i>boshto</i>; or, as old Mrs. Buckland said to me at Oaklands Park, in
Philadelphia, &ldquo;a <i>pis&#257;li</i> is the same thing with a
<i>boshto</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will gain thy faith?&rdquo; said Quentin Durward to
Hayradden Maugrabhin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Kindness,&rdquo; answered the gypsy.</p>
<p>The joint families, solely with intent to please us, although they never
said a word about it, next sent for a young Romany, one of the Lees, and
his wife <!-- page 219--><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>whom they supposed we would like to meet.&nbsp; Walking along the
Front, I met the tinker&rsquo;s wife with the handsomest Romany girl I ever
beheld.&nbsp; In a London ball-room or on the stage she would have been a
really startling beauty.&nbsp; This was young Mrs. Lee.&nbsp; Her husband
was a clever violinist, and it was very remarkable that when he gave
himself up to playing, with <i>abandon</i> or self-forgetfulness, there
came into his melodies the same wild gypsy expression, the same chords and
tones, which abound in the music of the Austrian Tsigane.&nbsp; It was not
my imagination which prompted the recognition; the Palmer also observed it,
without thinking it remarkable.&nbsp; From the playing of both Mat Woods
and young Lee, I am sure that there has survived among the Welsh gypsies
some of the spirit of their old Eastern music, just as in the solo dancing
of Mat&rsquo;s sister there was precisely the same kind of step which I had
seen in Moscow.&nbsp; Among the hundreds of the race whom I have met in
Great Britain, I have never known any young people who were so purely
Romany as these.&nbsp; The tinker and Anselo with his wife had judged
wisely that we would be pleased with this picturesque couple.&nbsp; They
always seemed to me in the house like two wild birds, and tropical ones at
that, in a cage.&nbsp; There was a tawny-gold, black and scarlet tone about
them and their garb, an Indian Spanish duskiness and glow which I loved to
look at.</p>
<p>Every proceeding of the tinker and Anselo was veiled in mystery and
hidden in the obscurity so dear to such grown-up children, but as I
observed after a few days that Lee did nothing beyond acting as assistant
to the tinker at the wheel, I surmised that the visit was solely for our
benefit.&nbsp; As the tinker <!-- page 220--><a name="page220"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 220</span>was devoted to his poor wife, so was Anselo
and his dame devoted to their child.&nbsp; He was, indeed, a brave little
fellow, and frequently manifested the precocious pluck and sturdiness so
greatly admired by the Romanys of the road; and when he would take a whip
and lead the horse, or in other ways show his courage, the delight of his
parents was in its turn delightful.&nbsp; They would look at the child as
if charmed, and then at one another with feelings too deep for words, and
then at me for sympathetic admiration.</p>
<p>The keeper of the house where they lodged was in his way a character and
a linguist.&nbsp; Welsh was his native tongue and English his second
best.&nbsp; He also knew others, such as Romany, of which he was proud, and
the Shelta or Minklas of the tinkers, of which he was not.&nbsp; The only
language which he knew of which he was really ashamed was Italian, and
though he could maintain a common conversation in it he always denied that
he remembered more than a few words.&nbsp; For it was not as the tongue of
Dante, but as the lingo of organ-grinders and such &ldquo;catenone&rdquo;
that he knew it, and I think that the Palmer and I lost dignity in his eyes
by inadvertently admitting that it was familiar to us.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
shouldn&rsquo;t have thought it,&rdquo; was all his comment on the
discovery, but I knew his thought, and it was that we had made ourselves
unnecessarily familiar with vulgarity.</p>
<p>It is not every one who is aware of the extent to which Italian is known
by the lower orders in London.&nbsp; It is not spoken as a language; but
many of its words, sadly mangled, are mixed with English as a jargon.&nbsp;
Thus the Italian <i>scappare</i>, to escape, or run away, has become
<i>scarper</i>; and a dweller in the <!-- page 221--><a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>Seven Dials has been
heard to say he would &ldquo;<i>scarper</i> with the <i>feele</i> of the
<i>donna</i> of the <i>cassey</i>;&rdquo; which means, run away with the
daughter of the landlady of the house, and which, as the editor of the
Slang Dictionary pens, is almost pure Italian,&mdash;<i>scappare colla
figlia della donna</i>, <i>della casa</i>.&nbsp; Most costermongers call a
penny a <i>saltee</i>, from <i>soldo</i>; a crown, a <i>caroon</i>; and one
half, <i>madza</i>, from <i>mezza</i>.&nbsp; They count as

<p>Mr. Hotten says that he could never discover the derivation of
<i>beong</i>, or <i>beonk</i>.&nbsp; It is very plainly the Italian
<i>bianco</i>, white, which, like <i>blanc</i> in French and <i>blank</i>
in German, is often applied slangily to a silver coin.&nbsp; It is as if
one had said, &ldquo;a shiner.&rdquo;&nbsp; Apropos <!-- page 222--><a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>of which word there
is something curious to be noted.&nbsp; It came forth in evidence, a few
years ago in England, that burglars or other thieves always carried with
them a piece of coal; and on this disclosure, a certain writer, in his
printed collection of curiosities, comments as if it were a superstition,
remarking that the coal is carried for an amulet.&nbsp; But the truth is
that the thief has no such idea.&nbsp; The coal is simply a sign for money;
and when the bearer meets with a man whom he thinks may be a
&ldquo;fence,&rdquo; or a purchaser of stolen goods, he shows the coal,
which is as much as to say, Have you money?&nbsp; Money, in vulgar gypsy,
is <i>wongur</i>, a corruption of the better word <i>angar</i>, which also
means a hot coal; and <i>braise</i>, in French <i>arg&ocirc;t</i>, has the
same double meaning.&nbsp; I may be wrong, but I suspect that <i>rat</i>, a
dollar in Hebrew, or at least in Schmussen, has its root in common with
<i>ratzafim</i>, coals, and possibly <i>poschit</i>, a farthing, with
<i>pecham</i>, coal.&nbsp; In the six kinds of fire mentioned in the
Talmud, <a name="citation222"></a><a href="#footnote222"
class="citation">[222]</a> there is no identification of coals with money;
but in the German legends of Rubezahl, there is a tale of a charcoal-burner
who found them changed to gold.&nbsp; Coins are called shiners because they
shine like glowing coals, and I dare say that the simile exists in many
more languages.</p>
<p>One twilight we found in the public sitting-room of the lodging-house a
couple whom I can never forget.&nbsp; It was an elderly gypsy and his
wife.&nbsp; The husband was himself characteristic; the wife was more than
merely picturesque.&nbsp; I have never met such a superb old Romany as she
was; indeed, I doubt if I ever saw any woman of her age, in any land or any
range of life, with a more magnificently proud <!-- page 223--><a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>expression or such
unaffected dignity.&nbsp; It was the whole poem of
&ldquo;Crescentius&rdquo; living in modern time in other form.</p>
<p>When a scholar associates much with gypsies there is developed in him in
due time a perception or intuition of certain kinds of men or minds, which
it is as difficult to describe as it is wonderful.&nbsp; He who has read
Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gipsy Scholar&rdquo; may, however, find
therein many apt words for it.&nbsp; I mean very seriously what I say; I
mean that through the Romany the demon of Socrates acquires distinctness; I
mean that a faculty is developed which is as strange as divination, and
which is greatly akin to it.&nbsp; The gypsies themselves apply it directly
to palmistry; were they well educated they would feel it in higher
forms.&nbsp; It may be reached among other races and in other modes, and
Nature is always offering it to us freely; but it seems to live, or at
least to be most developed, among the Romany.&nbsp; It comes upon the
possessor far more powerfully when in contact with certain lives than with
others, and with the sympathetic it takes in at a glance that which may
employ it at intervals for years to think out.</p>
<p>And by this <i>d&#363;k</i> I read in a few words in the Romany woman an
eagle soul, caged between the bars of poverty, ignorance, and custom; but a
great soul for all that.&nbsp; Both she and her husband were of the old
type of their race, now so rare in England, though commoner in
America.&nbsp; They spoke Romany with inflection and conjugation; they
remembered the old rhymes and old words, which I quoted freely, with the
Palmer.&nbsp; Little by little, the old man seemed to be deeply impressed,
indeed awed, by our utterly inexplicable <!-- page 224--><a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>knowledge.&nbsp; I
wore a velveteen coat, and had on a broad, soft felt hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk as the old Romanys did,&rdquo; said the old man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I hear you use words which I once heard from old men who died when I
was a boy.&nbsp; I thought those words were lying in graves which have long
been green.&nbsp; I hear songs and sayings which I never expected to hear
again.&nbsp; You talk like gypsies, and such gypsies as I never meet now;
and you look like Gorgios.&nbsp; But when I was still young, a few of the
oldest Romany <i>chals</i> still wore hats such as you have; and when I
first looked at you, I thought of them.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t understand
you.&nbsp; It is strange, very strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the Romany <i>soul</i>,&rdquo; said his wife.&nbsp;
&ldquo;People take to what is in them; if a bird were born a fox, it would
love to fly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wondered what flights she would have taken if she had wings.&nbsp; But
I understood why the old man had spoken as he did; for, knowing that we had
intelligent listeners, the Palmer and I had brought forth all our best and
quaintest Romany curios, and these rural Welsh wanderers were not, like
their English pals, familiar with Romany ryes.&nbsp; And I was moved to
like them, and nobody perceives this sooner than a gypsy.&nbsp; The old
couple were the parents of young Lee, and said they had come to visit him;
but I think that it was rather to see us that we owed their presence in
Aberystwith.&nbsp; For the tinker and Anselo were at this time engaged, in
their secret and owl-like manner, as befitted men who were up to all manner
of ways that were dark, in collecting the most interesting specimens of
Romanys, for our especial study; and whenever this could be managed so that
it <!-- page 225--><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>appeared entirely accidental and a surprise, then they retired
into their shadowed souls and chuckled with fiendish glee at having managed
things so charmingly.&nbsp; But it will be long ere I forget how the old
man&rsquo;s eye looked into the past as he recalled,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The hat of antique shape and coat of gray,<br />
&nbsp;  The same the gypsies wore,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and went far away back through my words to words heard in the olden
time, by fires long since burnt out, beneath the flame-gilt branches of
forests which have sailed away as ships, farther than woods e&rsquo;er went
from Dunsinane, and been wrecked in Southern seas.&nbsp; But though I could
not tell exactly what was in every room, I knew into what house his soul
had gone; and it was for this that the scholar-gypsy went from Oxford halls
&ldquo;to learn strange arts and join a gypsy tribe.&rdquo;&nbsp; His
friends had gone from earth long since, and were laid to sleep; some,
perhaps, far in the wold and wild, amid the rocks, where fox and wild bird
were their visitors; but for an instant they rose again from their graves,
and I knew them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They could do wonders by the power of the imagination,&rdquo;
says Glanvil of the gypsies; &ldquo;their fancy binding that of
others.&rdquo;&nbsp; Understand by imagination and fancy all that Glanvil
really meant, and I agree with him.&nbsp; It is a matter of history that,
since the Aryan morning of mankind, the Romanys have been chiromancing,
and, following it, trying to read people&rsquo;s minds and bind them to
belief.&nbsp; Thousands of years of transmitted hereditary influences
always result in something; it has really resulted with the gypsies in an
instinctive, though undeveloped, intuitive <!-- page 226--><a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>perception, which a
sympathetic mind acquires from them,&mdash;nay, is compelled to acquire,
out of mere self-defense; and when gained, it manifests itself in many
forms,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But it needs heaven-sent moments for this skill.&rdquo;</p>

227</span>AMERICAN GYPSIES.</h2>
<h3>I.&nbsp; GYPSIES IN PHILADELPHIA.</h3>
<p>It is true that the American gypsy has grown more vigorous in this
country, and, like many plants, has thriven better for being trans&mdash;I
was about to write incautiously <i>ported</i>, but, on second thought, say
<i>planted</i>.&nbsp; Strangely enough, he is more Romany than ever.&nbsp;
I have had many opportunities of studying both the elders from England and
the younger gypsies, born of English parents, and I have found that there
is unquestionably a great improvement in the race here, even from a gypsy
stand-point.&nbsp; The young sapling, under more favorable influences, has
pushed out from the old root, and grown stronger.&nbsp; The causes for this
are varied.&nbsp; Gypsies, like peacocks, thrive best when allowed to range
afar.&nbsp; <i>Il faut leur donner le clef des champs</i> (you must give
them the key of the fields), as I once heard an old Frenchman, employed on
Delmonico&rsquo;s Long Island farm, lang syne, say of that splendid
poultry.&nbsp; And what a range they have, from the Atlantic to the
Pacific!&nbsp; Marry, sir, &rsquo;t is like roaming from sunrise to sunset,
east and west, &ldquo;and from the aurora borealis to a Southern
blue-jay,&rdquo; and no man shall make them afraid.&nbsp; Wood!&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;t is a <i>kushto tem for k&#257;sht</i>&rdquo; <!--
page 228--><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>(a fair
land for timber), as a very decent <i>Romani-chal</i> said to me one
afternoon.&nbsp; It was thinking of him which led me to these remarks.</p>
<p>I had gone with my niece&mdash;who speaks Romany&mdash;out to a gypsyry
by Oaklands Park, and found there one of our good people, with his wife and
children, in a tent.&nbsp; Hard by was the wagon and the horse, and, after
the usual initiatory amazement at being accosted in the <i>k&#257;lo
jib</i>, or black language, had been survived, we settled down into
conversation.&nbsp; It was a fine autumnal day, Indian-summery,&mdash;the
many in one of all that is fine in weather all the world over, put into a
single glorious sense,&mdash;a sense of bracing air and sunshine not
over-bold or bright, and purple, tawny hues in western skies, and dim,
sweet feelings of the olden time.&nbsp; And as we sat lounging in lowly
seats, and talked about the people and their ways, it seemed to me as if I
were again in Devonshire or Surrey.&nbsp; Our host&mdash;for every gypsy
who is visited treats you as a guest, thus much Oriental politeness being
deeply set in him&mdash;had been in America from boyhood, but he seemed to
be perfectly acquainted with all whom I had known over the sea.&nbsp; Only
one thing he had not heard, the death of old Gentilla Cooper, of the
Devil&rsquo;s Dyke, near Brighton, for I had just received a letter from
England announcing the sad news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, this America is a good country for travelers.&nbsp; <i>We
can go South in winter</i>.&nbsp; Aye, the land is big enough to go to a
warm side in winter, and a cool one in summer.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t go
South, because I don&rsquo;t like the people; I don&rsquo;t get along with
them.&nbsp; <i>Some Romanys do</i>.&nbsp; Yes, but I&rsquo;m not on that
horse, I hear that the old country&rsquo;s getting to be a hard <!-- page
229--><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>place for
our people.&nbsp; Yes, just as you say, there&rsquo;s no <i>tan to
hatch</i>, no place to stay in there, unless you pay as much as if you went
to a hotel.&nbsp; &rsquo;T isn&rsquo;t so here.&nbsp; Some places
they&rsquo;re uncivil, but mostly we can get wood and water, and a place
for a tent, and a bite for the old <i>gry</i> [horse].&nbsp; The country
people like to see us come, in many places.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re more
high-minded and hon&rsquo;rable here than they are in England.&nbsp; If we
can cheat them in horse-dealin&rsquo; they stand it as gentlemen always
ought to do among themselves in such games.&nbsp; Horse-dealin&rsquo; is
horse-stealin&rsquo;, in a way, among real gentlemen.&nbsp; If I can Jew
you or you do me, it&rsquo;s all square in gamblin&rsquo;, and nobody has
any call to complain.&nbsp; Therefore, I allow that Americans are higher up
as gentlemen than what they are in England.&nbsp; It is not all of one
side, like a jug-handle, either.&nbsp; Many of these American farmers can
cheat me, and have done it, and are proud of it.&nbsp; Oh, yes;
they&rsquo;re much higher toned here.&nbsp; In England, if you put off a
<i>bavolengro</i> [broken-winded horse] on a fellow he comes after you with
a <i>chinam&#257;ngri</i> [writ].&nbsp; Here he goes like a man and
swindles somebody else with the <i>gry</i>, instead of sneaking off to a
magistrate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;England&rsquo;s a little
country, very little, indeed, but it is astonishing how many Romanys come
out of it over here.&nbsp; <i>Do I notice any change in them after
coming</i>?&nbsp; I do.&nbsp; When they first come, they drink liquor or
beer all the time.&nbsp; After a while they stop heavy drinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I may here observe that even in England the gypsy, although his getting
drunk is too often regulated or limited simply by his means, seldom shows
in his person the results of long-continued intemperance.&nbsp; <!-- page
230--><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>Living in
the open air, taking much exercise, constantly practicing boxing, rough
riding, and other manly sports, he is &ldquo;as hard as nails,&rdquo; and
generally lives to a hearty old age.&nbsp; As he very much prefers beer to
spirits, it may be a question whether excess in such drinking is really any
serious injury to him.&nbsp; The ancestors of the common English peasants
have for a thousand, it may be for two thousand, years or more all got
drunk on beer, whenever they could afford it, and yet a more powerful human
being than the English peasant does not exist.&nbsp; It may be that the
weaklings all die at an early age.&nbsp; This I cannot deny, nor that those
who survive are simply so tough that beer cannot kill them.&nbsp; What this
gypsy said of the impartial and liberal manner in which he and his kind are
received by the farmers is also true.&nbsp; I once conversed on this
subject with a gentleman farmer, and his remarks were much like those of
the Rom.&nbsp; I inferred from what he said that the coming of a party of
gypsy horse-dealers into his neighborhood was welcomed much as the
passengers on a Southern steamboat were wont of old to welcome the
proprietor of a portable faro bank.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;that the last time the gypsies were here they left more than they
took away.&rdquo;&nbsp; An old Rom told me once that in some parts of New
Jersey they were obliged to watch their tents and wagons very carefully for
fear of the country people.&nbsp; I do not answer for the truth of
this.&nbsp; It speaks vast volumes for the cleverness of gypsies that they
can actually make a living by trading horses in New Spain.</p>
<p>It is very true that in many parts of America the wanderers are welcomed
with <i>feux de joie</i>, or with salutes of shot-guns,&mdash;the guns,
unfortunately, being <!-- page 231--><a name="page231"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 231</span>shotted and aimed at them.&nbsp; I have
mentioned in another chapter, on a Gypsy Magic Spell, that once in
Tennessee, when an old Romany mother had succeeded in hoaxing a
farmer&rsquo;s wife out of all she had in the world, the neighboring
farmers took the witch, and, with a view to preventing effectually further
depredation, caused her to pass &ldquo;through flames material and temporal
unto flames immaterial and eternal;&rdquo; that is to say, they burned her
alive.&nbsp; But the gypsy would much prefer having to deal with lynchers
than with lawyers.&nbsp; Like the hedge-hog, which is typically a gypsy
animal, he likes better to be eaten by those of his own kind than to be
crushed into dirt by those who do not understand him.&nbsp; This story of
the hedge-hog was cited from my first gypsy book by Sir Charles Dilke, in a
speech in which he made an application of it to certain conservatives who
remained blindly suffering by their own party.&nbsp; It will hold good
forever.&nbsp; Gypsies never flourished so in Europe as during the days
when every man&rsquo;s hand was against them.&nbsp; It is said that they
raided and plundered about Scotland for fifty years before they were
definitely discovered to be mere marauders, for the Scots themselves were
so much given up to similar pursuits that the gypsies passed unnoticed.</p>
<p>The American gypsies do not beg, like their English brothers, and
particularly their English sisters.&nbsp; This fact speaks volumes for
their greater prosperity and for the influence which association with a
proud race has on the poorest people.&nbsp; Our friends at Oaklands always
welcomed us as guests.&nbsp; On another occasion when we went there, I said
to my niece, &ldquo;If we find strangers who do not know us, do not <!--
page 232--><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>speak
at first in Romany.&nbsp; Let us astonish them.&rdquo;&nbsp; We came to a
tent, before which sat a very dark, old-fashioned gypsy woman.&nbsp; I
paused before her, and said in English,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you tell a fortune for a young lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She don&rsquo;t want her fortune told,&rdquo; replied the old
woman, suspiciously and cautiously, or it may be with a view of drawing us
on.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t tell fortunes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this the young lady was so astonished that, without thinking of what
she was saying, or in what language, she cried,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dordi</i>!&nbsp; <i>Can&rsquo;t tute pen
dukkerin</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; (Look!&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you tell fortunes?)</p>
<p>This unaffected outburst had a greater effect than the most deeply
studied theatrical situation could have brought about.&nbsp; The old dame
stared at me and at the lady as if bewildered, and cried,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of God, what kind of gypsies are
<i>you</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! <i>mendui shom bori chovihani</i>!&rdquo; cried L., laughing;
&ldquo;we are a great witch and a wizard, and if you can&rsquo;t tell me my
fortune, I&rsquo;ll tell yours.&nbsp; Hold out your hand, and cross mine
with a dollar, and I&rsquo;ll tell you as big a lie as you ever
<i>penned</i> a <i>galderli Gorgio</i> [a green Gentile].&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; exclaimed the gypsy, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll believe that
you can tell fortunes or do anything!&nbsp; <i>Dordi</i>! <i>dordi</i>! but
this is wonderful.&nbsp; Yet you&rsquo;re not the first Romany
<i>r&#257;ni</i> [lady] I ever met.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s one in Delaware: a
<i>boridiri</i> [very great] lady she is, and true Romany,&mdash;<i>flick o
the jib te rinkeni adosta</i> [quick of tongue and fair of face].&nbsp;
Well, I am glad to see you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is that talking
there?&rdquo; cried a man&rsquo;s voice <!-- page 233--><a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>from within the
tent.&nbsp; He had heard Romany, and he spoke it, and came out expecting to
see familiar faces.&nbsp; His own was a study, as his glance encountered
mine.&nbsp; As soon as he understood that I came as a friend, he gave way
to infinite joy, mingled with sincerest grief that he had not at hand the
means of displaying hospitality to such distinguished Romanys as we
evidently were.&nbsp; He bewailed the absence of strong drink.&nbsp; Would
we have some tea made?&nbsp; Would I accompany him to the next tavern, and
have some beer?&nbsp; All at once a happy thought struck him.&nbsp; He went
into the tent and brought out a piece of tobacco, which I was compelled to
accept.&nbsp; Refusal would have been unkind, for it was given from the
very heart.&nbsp; George Borrow tells us that, in Spain, a poor gypsy once
brought him a pomegranate as a first acquaintanceship token.&nbsp; A gypsy
is a gypsy wherever you find him.</p>
<p>These were very nice people.&nbsp; The old dame took a great liking to
L., and showed it in pleasant manners.&nbsp; The couple were both English,
and liked to talk with me of the old country and the many mutual friends
whom we had left behind.&nbsp; On another visit, L. brought a scarlet silk
handkerchief, which she had bound round her head and tied under her chin in
a very gypsy manner.&nbsp; It excited, as I anticipated, great admiration
from the old dame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ah kenn&#257; tute dikks rinkeni</i>&mdash;now you look
nice.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the way a Romany lady ought to wear it!&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t she look just as Alfi used to look?&rdquo; she cried to her
husband.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just such eyes and hair!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here L. took off the <i>diklo</i>, or handkerchief, and passed it round
the gypsy woman&rsquo;s head, and tied it under her chin,
saying,&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 234--><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>&ldquo;I am sure it becomes you much more than it does me.&nbsp;
Now you look nice:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Red and yellow for Romany,<br />
And blue and pink for the Gorgiee.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We rose to depart, the old dame offered back to L. her handkerchief,
and, on being told to keep it, was greatly pleased.&nbsp; I saw that the
way in which it was given had won her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear what the old woman said while she was telling your
fortune?&rdquo; asked L., after we had left the tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I think of it, I remember that she or you had hold of my
hand, while I was talking with the old man, and he was making merry with my
whisky.&nbsp; I was turned away, and around so that I never noticed what
you two were saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She <i>penned</i> your <i>dukkerin</i>, and it was
wonderful.&nbsp; She said that she must tell it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here L. told me what the old <i>dye</i> had insisted on reading in
my hand.&nbsp; It was simply very remarkable, and embraced an apparent
knowledge of the past, which would make any credulous person believe in her
happy predictions of the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I suppose the <i>dukk</i> told it
to her.&nbsp; She may be an eye-reader.&nbsp; A hint dropped here and
there, unconsciously, the expression of the face, and a life&rsquo;s
practice will make anybody a witch.&nbsp; And if there ever was a
witch&rsquo;s eye, she has it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to have her picture,&rdquo; said L., &ldquo;in that
<i>lullo diklo</i> [red handkerchief].&nbsp; She looked like all the
sorceresses of Thessaly and Egypt in one, and, as Bulwer says of the Witch
of Vesuvius, was all the more terrible for having been
beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some time after this we went, with Britannia Lee <!-- page 235--><a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>a-gypsying, not
figuratively, but literally, over the river into New Jersey.&nbsp; And our
first greeting, as we touched the ground, was of good omen, and from a
great man, for it was Walt Whitman.&nbsp; It is not often that even a poet
meets with three sincerer admirers than the venerable bard encountered on
this occasion; so, of course, we stopped and talked, and L. had the
pleasure of being the first to communicate to Bon Gualtier certain pleasant
things which had recently been printed of him by a distinguished English
author, which is always an agreeable task.&nbsp; Blessed upon the
mountains, or at the Camden ferryboat, or anywhere, are the feet of anybody
who bringeth glad tidings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, are you going to see gypsies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are.&nbsp; We three gypsies be.&nbsp; By the abattoir.&nbsp;
<i>Au revoir</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And on we went to the place where I had first found gypsies in
America.&nbsp; All was at first so still that it seemed if no one could be
camped in the spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Se kekno adoi</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; (There&rsquo;s nobody
there.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dordi</i>!&rdquo; cried Britannia, &ldquo;<i>Dikkava me o tuv
te tan te wardo</i>.&nbsp; [I see a smoke, a tent, a wagon.]&nbsp; I
declare, it is my <i>puro pal</i>, my old friend, W.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And we drew near the tent and greeted its owner, who was equally
astonished and delighted at seeing such distinguished Romany <i>t&#257;ni
r&#257;nis</i>, or gypsy young ladies, and brought forth his wife and three
really beautiful children to do the honors.&nbsp; W. was a good specimen of
an American-born gypsy, strong, healthy, clean, and temperate, none the
worse for wear in out-of-dooring, through tropical summers and terrible
winters.&nbsp; Like all American Romanys, he was more <!-- page 236--><a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>straightforward than
most of his race in Europe.&nbsp; All Romanys are polite, but many of the
European kind are most uncomfortably and unconsciously na&iuml;ve.&nbsp;
Strange that the most innocent people should be those who most offend
morality.&nbsp; I knew a lady once&mdash;Heaven grant that I may never meet
with such another!&mdash;who had been perfectly educated in entire purity
of soul.&nbsp; And I never knew any <i>devergond&eacute;e</i> who could so
shock, shame, and pain decent people as this Agnes did in her sweet
ignorance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never forget the first day you came to my camp,&rdquo;
said W. to Britannia.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, you astonished me then.&nbsp; You
might have knocked me down with a feather.&nbsp; And I didn&rsquo;t know
what to say.&nbsp; You came in a carriage with two other ladies.&nbsp; And
you jumped out first, and walked up to me, and cried,
&lsquo;<i>Sa&rsquo;sh&#257;n</i>!&rsquo;&nbsp; That stunned me, but I
answered, &lsquo;<i>Sa&rsquo;sh&#257;n</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then I
didn&rsquo;t speak Romanes to you, for I didn&rsquo;t know but what you
kept it a secret from the other two ladies, and I didn&rsquo;t wish to
betray you.&nbsp; And when you began to talk it as deep as any old Romany I
ever heard, and pronounced it so rich and beautiful, I thought I&rsquo;d
never heard the like.&nbsp; I thought you must be a witch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Awer me shom chovihani</i>&rdquo; (but I am a witch), cried
the lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Mukka men j&#257; adr&eacute; o
tan</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Let us go into the tent.)&nbsp; So we entered, and
sat round the fire, and asked news of all the wanderers of the roads, and
the young ladies, having filled their pockets with sweets, produced them
for the children, and we were as much at home as we had ever been in any
salon; for it was a familiar scene to us all, though it would, perhaps,
have been a strange one to the reader, had <!-- page 237--><a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>he by chance, walking
that lonely way in the twilight, looked into the tent and asked his way,
and there found two young ladies&mdash;<i>bien mises</i>&mdash;with their
escort, all very much at their ease, and talking Romany as if they had
never known any other tongue from the cradle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the charm of all this?&rdquo;&nbsp; It is that if one has
a soul, and does not live entirely reflected from the little thoughts and
little ways of a thousand other little people, it is well to have at all
times in his heart some strong hold of nature.&nbsp; No matter how much we
may be lost in society, dinners, balls, business, we should never forget
that there is an eternal sky with stars over it all, a vast, mysterious
earth with terrible secrets beneath us, seas, mountains, rivers, and
forests away and around; and that it is from these and what is theirs, and
not from gas-lit, stifling follies, that all strength and true beauty must
come.&nbsp; To this life, odd as he is, the gypsy belongs, and to be
sometimes at home with him by wood and wold takes us for a time from
&ldquo;the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; If I express myself vaguely and imperfectly,
it is only to those who know not the charm of nature, its ineffable
soothing sympathy,&mdash;its life, its love.&nbsp; Gypsies, like children,
feel this enchantment as the older grown do not.&nbsp; To them it is a song
without words; would they be happier if the world brought them to know it
as words without song, without music or melody?&nbsp; I never read a right
old English ballad of sumere when the leaves are grene or the not-broune
maid, with its rustling as of sprays quivering to the song of the
wode-wale, without thinking or feeling deeply how those who wrote them
would have been bound to the Romany.&nbsp; It is ridiculous to say that
gypsies are not &ldquo;educated&rdquo; <!-- page 238--><a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>to nature and art,
when, in fact, they live it.&nbsp; I sometimes suspect that &aelig;sthetic
culture takes more true love of nature out of the soul than it
inspires.&nbsp; One would not say anything of a wild bird or deer being
deficient in a sense of that beauty of which it is a part.&nbsp; There are
infinite grades, kinds, or varieties of feeling of nature, and every man is
perfectly satisfied that his is the true one.&nbsp; For my own part, I am
not sure that a rabbit, in the dewy grass, does not feel the beauty of
nature quite as much as Mr. Ruskin, and much more than I do.</p>
<p>No poet has so far set forth the charm of gypsy life better than Lenau
has done, in his highly-colored, quickly-expressive ballad of &ldquo;Die
drei Zigeuner,&rdquo; of which I here give a translation into English and
another into Anglo-American Romany.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>THE THREE GYPSIES.</p>
<p>I saw three gypsy men, one day,<br />
&nbsp;  Camped in a field together,<br />
As my wagon went its weary way,<br />
&nbsp;  All over the sand and heather.</p>
<p>And one of the three whom I saw there<br />
&nbsp;  Had his fiddle just before him,<br />
And played for himself a stormy air,<br />
&nbsp;  While the evening-red shone o&rsquo;er him.</p>
<p>And the second puffed his pipe again<br />
&nbsp;  Serenely and undaunted,<br />
As if he at least of earthly men<br />
&nbsp;  Had all the luck that he wanted.</p>

&nbsp;  Their garments in holes and tatters;<br />
But they seemed to defy right sturdily<br />
&nbsp;  The world and all worldly matters.</p>
<p>Thrice to the soul they seemed to say,<br />
&nbsp;  When earthly trouble tries it,<br />
How to fiddle, sleep it, and smoke it away,<br />
&nbsp;  And so in three ways despise it.</p>
<p>And ever anon I look around,<br />

At the gypsy faces darkly browned,<br />

241</span>II.&nbsp; THE CROCUS-PITCHER. <a name="citation241"></a><a
href="#footnote241" class="citation">[241]</a>&nbsp; (PHILADELPHIA.)</h3>
<p>It was a fine spring noon, and the corner of Fourth and Library streets
in Philadelphia was like a rock in the turn of a rapid river, so great was
the crowd of busy business men which flowed past.&nbsp; Just out of the
current a man paused, put down a parcel which he carried, turned it into a
table, placed on it several vials, produced a bundle of hand-bills, and
began, in the language of his tribe, to <i>cant</i>&mdash;that is,
<i>cantare</i>, to sing&mdash;the virtues of a medicine which was certainly
<i>patent</i> in being spread out by him to extremest thinness.&nbsp; In an
instant there were a hundred people round him.&nbsp; He seemed to be well
known and waited for.&nbsp; I saw at a glance what he was.&nbsp; The dark
eye and brown face indicated a touch of the <i>diddikai</i>, or one with a
little gypsy blood in his veins, while his fluent patter and unabashed
boldness showed a long familiarity with race-grounds and the road, or with
the Cheap-Jack and Dutch auction business, and other pursuits requiring
unlimited eloquence and impudence.&nbsp; How many a man of learning, nay of
genius, might have paused and envied that vagabond the gifts which were
worth so little to their possessor!&nbsp; But what was remarkable about him
was that instead of endeavoring to conceal any gypsy <!-- page 242--><a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>indications, they
were manifestly exaggerated.&nbsp; He wore a broad-brimmed hat and
ear-rings and a red embroidered waistcoat of the most forcible old Romany
pattern, which was soon explained by his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to keep you waiting,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
always sorry to detain a select and genteel audience.&nbsp; But I was
detained myself by a very interesting incident.&nbsp; I was invited to
lunch with a wealthy German gentleman; a very wealthy German, I say, one of
the pillars of your city and front door-step of your council, and who would
be the steeple of your exchange, if it had one.&nbsp; And on arriving at
his house he remarked, &lsquo;Toctor, by tam you koom yust in goot dime,
for mine frau und die cook ish bote fall sick mit some-ding in a hoory, und
I kess she&rsquo;ll die pooty quick-sudden.&rsquo;&nbsp; Unfortunately I
had with me, gentlemen, but a single dose of my world-famous Gypsy&rsquo;s
Elixir and Romany Pharmacopheionepenth&eacute;.&nbsp; (That is the name,
gentlemen, but as I detest quackery I term it simply the Gypsy&rsquo;s
Elixir.)&nbsp; When the German gentleman learned that in all probability
but one life could be saved he said, &lsquo;Veil, denn, doctor, subbose you
gifes dat dose to de cook.&nbsp; For mine frau ish so goot dat it&rsquo;s
all right mit her.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s reaty to tie.&nbsp; But de boor gook
ish a sinner, ash I knows, und not reaty for de next world.&nbsp; And dere
ish no vomans in town dat can gook mine sauer-kraut ash she
do.&rsquo;&nbsp; Fortunately, gentlemen, I found in an unknown corner of a
forgotten pocket an unsuspected bottle of the Gypsy&rsquo;s Elixir, and
both interesting lives were saved with such promptitude, punctuality,
neatness and dispatch that the cook proceeded immediately to conclude the
preparation of our meal&mdash;(thank you sir,&mdash;one dollar, if you
please, sir.&nbsp; You say I only <!-- page 243--><a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>charged half a dollar
yesterday!&nbsp; That was for a smaller bottle, sir.&nbsp; Same size, as
this, was it?&nbsp; Ah, yes, I gave you a large bottle by mistake,&mdash;so
you owe me fifty cents.&nbsp; Never mind, don&rsquo;t give it back.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll take the half dollar.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>All of this had been spoken with the utmost volubility.&nbsp; As I
listened I almost fancied myself again in England, and at a country
fair.&nbsp; Taking in his audience at a glance, I saw his eye rest on me
ere it flitted, and he resumed,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We gypsies are, as you know, a remarkable race, and possessed of
certain rare secrets, which have all been formulated, concentrated,
dictated, and plenipotentiarated into this idealized Elixir.&nbsp; If I
were a mountebank or a charlatan I would claim that it cures a hundred
diseases.&nbsp; Charlatan is a French word for a quack.&nbsp; I speak
French, gentlemen; I speak nine languages, and can tell you the Hebrew for
an old umbrella.&nbsp; The Gypsy&rsquo;s Elixir cures colds, gout, all
nervous affections, with such cutaneous disorders as are diseases of the
skin, debility, sterility, hostility, and all the illities that flesh is
heir to except what it can&rsquo;t, such as small-pox and cholera.&nbsp; It
has cured cholera, but it don&rsquo;t claim to do it.&nbsp; Others claim to
cure, but can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I am not a charlatan, but an Ann-Eliza.&nbsp;
That is the difference between me and a lady, as the pig said when he
astonished his missus by blushing at her remarks to the postman.&nbsp;
(<i>Better have another bottle</i>, <i>sir</i>.&nbsp; <i>Haven&rsquo;t you
the change</i>?&nbsp; <i>Never mind</i>, <i>you can owe me fifty
cents</i>.&nbsp; <i>I know a gentleman when I see one</i>.)&nbsp; I was
recently Down East in Maine, where they are so patriotic, they all put the
stars and stripes into their beds for sheets, have the Fourth of July three
hundred and sixty-five times in <!-- page 244--><a name="page244"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 244</span>the year, and eat the Declaration of
Independence for breakfast.&nbsp; And they wouldn&rsquo;t buy a bottle of
my Gypsy&rsquo;s Elixir till they heard it was good for the Constitution,
whereupon they immediately purchased my entire stock.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
lose time in securing this invaluable blessing to those who feel occasional
pains in the lungs.&nbsp; This is not taradiddle.&nbsp; I am engaged to
lecture this afternoon before the Medical Association of Germantown, as on
Wednesday before the University of Baltimore; for though I sell medicine
here in the streets, it is only, upon my word of honor, that the poor may
benefit, and the lowly as well as the learned know how to prize the
philanthropic and eccentric gypsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He run on with his patter for some time in this vein, and sold several
vials of his panacea, and then in due time ceased, and went into a
bar-room, which I also entered.&nbsp; I found him in what looked like
prospective trouble, for a policeman was insisting on purchasing his
medicine, and on having one of his hand-bills.&nbsp; He was remonstrating,
when I quietly said to him in Romany, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself;
you were not making any disturbance.&rdquo;&nbsp; He took no apparent
notice of what I said beyond an almost imperceptible wink, but soon left
the room, and when I had followed him into the street, and we were out of
ear-shot, he suddenly turned on me and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you <i>are</i> a swell, for a Romany.&nbsp; How do you do
it up to such a high peg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do the whole lay,&mdash;look so gorgeous?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m no better dressed than you are,&mdash;not so well,
if you come to that <i>vongree</i>&rdquo; (waistcoat).</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;T isn&rsquo;t <i>that</i>,&mdash;&rsquo;t isn&rsquo;t the
clothes.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the air <!-- page 245--><a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>and the style.&nbsp;
Anybody&rsquo;d believe you&rsquo;d had no end of an education.&nbsp; I
could make ten dollars a patter if I could do it as natural as you
do.&nbsp; Perhaps you&rsquo;d like to come in on halves with me as a
bonnet.&nbsp; <i>No</i>?&nbsp; Well, I suppose you have a better
line.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve been lucky.&nbsp; I tell you, you astonished me
when you <i>rakkered</i>, though I spotted you in the crowd for one who was
off the color of the common Gorgios,&mdash;or, as the Yahudi say, the
<i>Goyim</i>.&nbsp; No, I carn&rsquo;t <i>rakker</i>, or none to speak of,
and noways as deep as you, though I was born in a tent on Battersea Common
and grew up a fly fakir.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the drab made of that I sell in
these bottles?&nbsp; Why, the old fake, of course,&mdash;you needn&rsquo;t
say <i>you</i> don&rsquo;t know that.&nbsp; <i>Italic good
English</i>.&nbsp; Yes, I know I do.&nbsp; A fakir is bothered out of his
life and chaffed out of half his business when he drops his
<i>h</i>&rsquo;s.&nbsp; A man can do anything when he must, and I must talk
fluently and correctly to succeed in such a business.&nbsp; <i>Would I like
a drop of something</i>?&nbsp; You paid for the last, now you must take a
drop with me.&nbsp; <i>Do I know of any Romany&rsquo;s in town</i>?&nbsp;
Lots of them.&nbsp; There is a ken in Lombard Street with a regular fly
mort,&mdash;but on second thoughts we won&rsquo;t go
there,&mdash;<i>and</i>&mdash;oh, I say&mdash;a very nice place in ---
Street.&nbsp; The landlord is a Yahud; his wife can <i>rakker</i> you,
I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; <i>She&rsquo;s</i> a good lot, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And while on the way I will explain that my acquaintance was not to be
regarded as a real gypsy.&nbsp; He was one of that large nomadic class with
a tinge of gypsy blood who have grown up as waifs and strays, and who,
having some innate cleverness, do the best they can to live without
breaking the law&mdash;much.&nbsp; They deserve pity, for they have never
been cared for; they owe nothing to society for kindness, and <!-- page
246--><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>yet they are
held even more strictly to account by the law than if they had been
regularly Sunday-schooled from babyhood.&nbsp; This man when he spoke of
Romanys did not mean real gypsies; he used the word as it occurs in
Ainsworth&rsquo;s song of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Nix my dolly, pals fake away.<br />
And here I am both tight and free,<br />
A regular rollicking Romany.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For he meant <i>Bohemian</i> in its widest and wildest sense, and to him
all that was apart from the world was <i>his</i> world, whether it was Rom
or Yahudi, and whether it conversed in Romany or Schmussen, or any other
tongue unknown to the Gentiles.&nbsp; He had indeed no home, and had never
known one.</p>
<p>It was not difficult to perceive that the place to which he led me was
devoted in the off hours to some other business besides the selling of
liquor.&nbsp; It was neat and quiet, in fact rather sleepy; but its card,
which was handed to me, stated in a large capital head-line that it was
OPEN ALL NIGHT, and that there was pool at all hours.&nbsp; I conjectured
that a little game might also be performed there at all hours, and that,
like the fountain of Jupiter Ammon, it became livelier as it grew later,
and that it certainly would not be on the full boil before midnight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Scheiker fur mich</i>, <i>der Isch will jain soreff
shaskenen</i>&rdquo; (Beer for me and brandy for him), I said to the
landlord, who at once shook my hand and saluted me with
<i>Sholem</i>!&nbsp; Even so did Ben Daoud of Jerusalem, not long
ago.&nbsp; Ben knew me not, and I was buying a pocket-book of him at his
open-air stand in Market Street, and talking German, while he was
endeavoring to convince me that I ought to give five cents more for it than
I had given for a similar case the <!-- page 247--><a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>day before, on the
ground that it was of a different color, or under color that the leather
had a different ground, I forget which.&nbsp; In talking I let fall the
word <i>kesef</i> (silver).&nbsp; In an instant Ben had taken my hand, and
said <i>Sholem aleichum</i>, and &ldquo;Can you talk
Spanish?&rdquo;&mdash;which was to show that he was superfine Sephardi, and
not common Ashkenaz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; resumed the crocus-fakir; &ldquo;a man must be able
to talk English very fluently, pronounce it correctly, and, above all
things, keep his temper, if he would do anything that requires chanting or
pattering.&nbsp; <i>How did I learn it</i>?&nbsp; A man can learn to do
anything when it&rsquo;s business and his living depends on it.&nbsp; The
people who crowd around me in the streets cannot pronounce English
decently; not one in a thousand here can say <i>laugh</i>, except as a
sheep says it.&nbsp; Suppose that you are a Cheap Jack selling things from
a van.&nbsp; About once in an hour some tipsy fellow tries to chaff
you.&nbsp; He hears your tongue going, and that sets his off.&nbsp; He
hears the people laugh at your jokes, and he wants them to laugh at
his.&nbsp; When you say you&rsquo;re selling to raise money for a
burned-out widow, he asks if she isn&rsquo;t your wife.&nbsp; Then you
answer him, &lsquo;No, but the kind-hearted old woman who found you on the
door-step and brought you up to the begging business.&rsquo;&nbsp; If you
say you are selling goods under cost, it&rsquo;s very likely some yokel
will cry out, &lsquo;Stolen, hey?&rsquo;&nbsp; And you patter as quick as
lightning, &lsquo;Very likely; I thought your wife sold &rsquo;em to me too
cheap for the good of somebody&rsquo;s clothes-line.&rsquo;&nbsp; If you
show yourself his superior in language awd wit, the people will buy better;
they always prefer a gentleman to a cad.&nbsp; Bless me! why, a swell in a
dress-coat and kid gloves, with good patter and hatter, can <!-- page
248--><a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>sell a
hundred rat-traps while a dusty cad in a flash kingsman would sell
one.&nbsp; As for the replies, most of them are old ones.&nbsp; As the men
who interrupt you are nearly all of the same kind, and have heads of very
much the same make, with an equal number of corners, it follows that they
all say nearly the same things.&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;ve heard two duffers cry
out the same thing at once to me.&nbsp; So you soon have answers cut and
dried for them.&nbsp; We call &rsquo;em <i>cocks</i>, because they&rsquo;re
just like half-penny ballads, all ready printed, while the pitcher always
has the one you want ready at his finger-ends.&nbsp; It is the same in all
canting.&nbsp; I knew a man once who got his living by singing of evenings
in the gaffs to the piano, and making up verses on the gentlemen and ladies
as they came in; and very nice verses he made, too,&mdash;always as smooth
as butter.&nbsp; <i>How do you do it</i>? I asked him one day.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well, you wouldn&rsquo;t believe it,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;but
they&rsquo;re mostly cocks.&nbsp; The best ones I buy for a tanner
[sixpence] apiece.&nbsp; If a tall gentleman with a big beard comes in, I
strike a deep chord and sing,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This tall and handsome party,<br />
&nbsp;  With such a lot of hair,<br />
Who seems so grand and hearty,<br />
&nbsp;  Must be a <i>militaire</i>;<br />
We like to see a swell come<br />
&nbsp;  Who looks so <i>distingu&eacute;</i>,<br />
So let us bid him welcome,<br />
&nbsp;  And hope he&rsquo;ll find us gay.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The last half can be used for anybody.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the way
the improvisatory business is managed for visitors.&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s
the same with fortune-telling.&nbsp; <i>You have noticed that</i>.&nbsp;
Well, if the Gorgios had, it would have been all up with the fake long
ago.&nbsp; The old woman has the same sort of girls come to her <!-- page
249--><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>with the
same old stories, over and over again, and she has a hundred dodges and
gets a hundred straight tips where nobody else would see anything; and of
course she has the same replies all ready.&nbsp; There is nothing like
being glib.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s really a great deal of the same in the
regular doctor business, as I know, coming close on to it and calling
myself one.&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;ve been called into a regular consultation
in Chicago, where I had an office,&mdash;&rsquo;pon my honor I was, and no
great honor neither.&nbsp; It was all patter, and I pattered &rsquo;em
dumb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I began to think that the fakir could talk forever and ever
faster.&nbsp; If he excelled in his business, he evidently practiced at all
times to do so.&nbsp; I intimated as much, and he at once proceeded
fluently to illustrate this point also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hear men say every day that if they only had an education
they would do great things.&nbsp; What it would all come to with most of
them is that they would <i>talk</i> so as to shut other men up and astonish
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; They have not an idea above that.&nbsp; I never had any
schooling but the roads and race-grounds, but I can talk the hat off a
lawyer, and that&rsquo;s all I can do.&nbsp; Any man of them could talk
well if he tried; but none of them will try, and as they go through life,
telling you how clever they&rsquo;d have been if somebody else had only
done something for them, instead of doing something for themselves.&nbsp;
So you must be going.&nbsp; Well, I hope I shall see you again.&nbsp; Just
come up when you&rsquo;re going by and say that your wife was raised from
the dead by my Elixir, and that it&rsquo;s the best medicine you ever
had.&nbsp; And if you want to see some regular tent gypsies, there&rsquo;s
a camp of them now just four miles from here; real old style <!-- page
250--><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>Romanys.&nbsp; Go out on the road four miles, and you&rsquo;ll
find them just off the side,&mdash;anybody will show you the place.&nbsp;
<i>Sarishan</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was sorry to read in the newspaper, a few days after, that the fakir
had been really arrested and imprisoned for selling a quack medicine.&nbsp;
For in this land of liberty it makes an enormous difference whether you
sell by advertisement in the newspapers or on the sidewalk, which shows
that there is one law for the rich and another for the poor, even in a
republic.</p>

251</span>III.&nbsp; GYPSIES IN CAMP.&nbsp;  (NEW JERSEY.)</h3>
<p>The Weather had put on his very worst clothes, and was never so hard at
work for the agricultural interests, or so little inclined to see visitors,
as on the Sunday afternoon when I started gypsying.&nbsp; The rain and the
wind were fighting one with another, and both with the mud, even as the
Jews in Jerusalem fought with themselves, and both with the
Romans,&mdash;which was the time when the <i>Shaket</i>, or butcher, killed
the ox who drank the water which quenched the fire which the reader has
often heard all about, yet not knowing, perhaps, that the house which Jack
built was the Holy Temple of Jerusalem.&nbsp; It was with such reflections
that I beguiled time on a long walk, for which I was not unfitly equipped
in corduroy trousers, with a long Ulster and a most disreputable cap
befitting a stable-boy.&nbsp; The rig, however, kept out the wet, and I was
too recently from England to care much that it was raining.&nbsp; I had
seen the sun on color about thirty times altogether during the past year,
and so had not as yet learned to miss him.&nbsp; It is on record that when
the Shah was in England a lady said to him, &ldquo;Can it be possible, your
highness, that there are in your dominions people who worship the
sun?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the monarch, musingly;
&ldquo;and so would you, if you could only see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 252--><a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>The houses became fewer as I went on, till at last I reached the
place near which I knew the gypsies must be camped.&nbsp; As is their
custom in England, they had so established themselves as not to be seen
from the road.&nbsp; The instinct which they display in thus getting near
people, and yet keeping out of their sight, even as rats do, is
remarkable.&nbsp; I thought I knew the town of Brighton, in England,
thoroughly, and had explored all its nooks, and wondered that I had never
found any gypsies there.&nbsp; One day I went out with a Romany
acquaintance, who, in a short time, took me to half a dozen tenting-places,
round corners in mysterious by-ways.&nbsp; It often happens that the spots
which they select to <i>hatch the tan</i>, or pitch the tent, are
picturesque bits, such as artists love, and all gypsies are fully
appreciative of beauty in this respect.&nbsp; It is not a week, as I write,
since I heard an old horse-dealing veteran of the roads apologize to me
with real feeling for the want of a view near his tent, just as any other
man might have excused the absence of pictures from his walls.&nbsp; The
most beautiful spot for miles around Williamsport, in Pennsylvania, a river
dell, which any artist would give a day to visit, is the favorite
camping-ground of the Romany.&nbsp; Woods and water, rocks and loneliness,
make it lovely by day, and when, at eventide, the fire of the wanderers
lights up the scene, it also lights up in the soul many a memory of tents
in the wilderness, of pictures in the Louvre, of Arabs and of Wouvermanns
and belated walks by the Thames, and of Salvator Rosa.&nbsp; Ask me why I
haunt gypsydom.&nbsp; It has put me into a thousand sympathies with nature
and art, which I had never known without it.&nbsp; The Romany, like the red
Indian, and all who dwell <!-- page 253--><a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>by wood and wold as outlawes wont to do, are
the best human links to bind us to their home-scenery, and lead us into its
inner life.&nbsp; What constitutes the antithetic charm of those wonderful
lines,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Afar in the desert, I love to ride,<br />
With the silent bush-boy alone by my side,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but the presence of the savage who belongs to the scene, and whose
<i>being</i> binds the poet to it, and blends him with it as the flux
causes the fire to melt the gold?</p>
<p>I left the road, turned the corner, and saw before me the low, round
tents, with smoke rising from the tops, dark at first and spreading into
light gray, like scalp-locks and feathers upon Indian heads.&nbsp; Near
them were the gayly-painted vans, in which I at once observed a difference
from the more substantial-looking old-country <i>vardo</i>.&nbsp; The whole
scene was so English that I felt a flutter at the heart: it was a bit from
over the sea; it seemed as if hedge-rows should have been round, and an old
Gothic steeple looking over the trees.&nbsp; I thought of the last gypsy
camp I had seen near Henley-on-Thames, and wished Plato Buckland were with
me to share the fun which one was always sure to have on such an occasion
in his eccentric company.&nbsp; But now Plato was, like his father in the
song,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Duro pardel the boro pan&#299;</i>,&rdquo;<br />
Far away over the broad-rolling sea,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and I must introduce myself.&nbsp; There was not a sign of life about,
save in a sorrowful hen, who looked as if she felt bitterly what it was to
be a Pariah among poultry and a down-pin, and who cluttered as if she might
have had a history of being borne from her bower in the dark midnight by
desperate African <!-- page 254--><a name="page254"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 254</span>reivers, of a wild moonlit flitting and
crossing black roaring torrents, drawn all the while by the neck, as a
Turcoman pulls a Persian prisoner on an &ldquo;alaman,&rdquo; with a rope,
into captivity, and finally of being sold unto the Egyptians.&nbsp; I drew
near a tent: all was silent, as it always is in a <i>tan</i> when the
foot-fall of the stranger is heard; but I knew that it was packed with
inhabitants.</p>
<p>I called in Romany my greeting, and bade somebody come out.&nbsp; And
there appeared a powerfully built, dark-browed, good-looking man of thirty,
who was as gypsy as Plato himself.&nbsp; He greeted me very civilly, but
with some surprise, and asked me what he could do for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask me in out of the rain, pal,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose I&rsquo;ve come four miles to see you and
stop out here, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was, indeed, reasonable, and I was invited to enter, which I did,
and found myself in a scene which would have charmed Callot or Goya.&nbsp;
There was no door or window to the black tent; what light there was came
through a few rifts and rents and mingled with the dull gleam of a
smoldering fire, producing a perfect Rembrandt blending of rosy-red with
dreamy half-darkness.&nbsp; It was a real witch-aura, and the denizens were
worthy of it.&nbsp; As my eyes gradually grew to the gloom, I saw that on
one side four brown old Romany sorceresses were &ldquo;<i>beshing
apr&eacute; ye pus</i>&rdquo; (sitting on the straw), as the song has it,
with deeper masses of darkness behind them, in which other forms were
barely visible.&nbsp; Their black eyes all flashed up together at me, like
those of a row of eagles in a cage; and I saw in a second that, with men
and all I was in a party who were anything but milksops; <!-- page 255--><a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>in fact, with as
regularly determined a lot of hard old Romanys as ever battered a
policeman.&nbsp; I confess that a feeling like a thrill of joy came over
me&mdash;a memory of old days and by-gone scenes over the sea&mdash;when I
saw this, and knew they were not <i>diddikais</i>, or half-breed
mumpers.&nbsp; On the other side, several young people, among them three or
four good-looking girls, were eating their four-o&rsquo;clock meal from a
canvas spread on the ground.&nbsp; There were perhaps twenty persons in the
place, including the children who swarmed about.</p>
<p>Even in a gypsy tent something depends on the style of a
self-introduction by a perfect stranger.&nbsp; Stepping forward, I divested
myself of my Ulster, and handed it to a nice damsel, giving her special
injunction to fold it up and lay it by.&nbsp; My <i>mise en
sc&egrave;ne</i> appeared to meet with approbation, and I stood forth and
remarked,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I am, glad to see you; and if you want to see a regular
<i>Romany rye</i> [gypsy gentleman], just over from England, now&rsquo;s
your chance.&nbsp; <i>Sarishan</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I received, as I expected, a cordial welcome.&nbsp; I was invited to
sit down and eat, but excused myself as having just come from
<i>h&#257;bben</i>, or food, and settled myself to a cigar.&nbsp; But while
everybody was polite, I felt that under it all there was a reserve, a
chill.&nbsp; I was altogether too heavy a mystery.&nbsp; I knew my friends,
and they did not know me.&nbsp; Something, however, now took place which
went far to promote conviviality.&nbsp; The tent-flap was lifted, and there
entered an elderly woman, who, as a gypsy, might have been the other four
in one, she was so quadruply dark, so fourfold uncanny, so too-too
witch-like in her eyes.&nbsp; The others had so far been reserved as to
speaking <!-- page 256--><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>Romany; she, glancing at me keenly, began at once to talk it very
fluently, without a word of English, with the intention of testing me; but
as I understood her perfectly, and replied with a burning gush of the same
language, being, indeed, glad to have at last &ldquo;got into my
plate,&rdquo; we were friends in a minute.&nbsp; I did not know then that I
was talking with a celebrity whose name has even been groomily recorded in
an English book; but I found at once that she was truly &ldquo;a
character.&rdquo;&nbsp; She had manifestly been sent for to test the
stranger, and I knew this, and made myself agreeable, and was evidently
found <i>tacho</i>, or all right.&nbsp; It being a rule, in fact, with few
exceptions, that when you really like people, in a friendly way, and are
glad to be among them, they never fail to find it out, and the jury always
comes to a favorable verdict.</p>
<p>And so we sat and talked on in the monotone in which Romany is generally
spoken, like an Indian song, while, like an Indian drum, the rain pattered
an accompaniment on the tightly drawn tent.&nbsp; Those who live in cities,
and who are always realizing self, and thinking how they think, and are
while awake given up to introverting vanity, never <i>live</i> in
song.&nbsp; To do this one must be a child, an Indian, a dweller in fields
and green forests, a brother of the rain and road-puddles and rolling
streams, and a friend of the rustling leaves and the summer orchestra of
frogs and crickets and rippling grass.&nbsp; Those who hear this music and
think to it never think about it; those who live only in books never sing
to it in soul.&nbsp; As there are dreams which <i>will not</i> be
remembered or known to <i>reason</i>, so this music shrinks from it.&nbsp;
It is wonderful how beauty perishes like a shade-grown <!-- page 257--><a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>flower before the
sunlight of analysis.&nbsp; It is dying out all the world over in women,
under the influence of cleverness and &ldquo;style;&rdquo; it is perishing
in poetry and art before criticism; it is wearing away from manliness,
through priggishness; it is being crushed out of true gentleness of heart
and nobility of soul by the pessimist puppyism of miching Mallockos.&nbsp;
But nature is eternal and will return.&nbsp; When man has run one of his
phases of culture fairly to the end, and when the fruit is followed by a
rattling rococo husk, then comes a winter sleep, from which he awakens to
grow again as a child-flower.&nbsp; We are at the very worst of such a
time; but there is a morning redness far away, which shows that the
darkness is ending, the winter past, the rain is over and gone.&nbsp;
Arise, and come away!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sossi kair&rsquo;d tute to av&rsquo;akai pardel o boro
p&#257;ni?&rdquo;&nbsp; (And what made you come here across the broad
water?) said the good old dame confidentially and kindly, in the same low
monotone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Si lesti chorin a gry?&rdquo;&nbsp; (Was it stealing
a horse?)</p>
<p><i>Dum</i>, <i>dum</i>, <i>dum</i>, <i>patter</i>, <i>patter</i>,
<i>dum</i>! played the rain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Avali I dikked your romus kaliko&rdquo;&nbsp; (I saw your husband
yesterday), remarked some one aside to a girl.</p>
<p><i>Dum</i>, <i>dum</i>, <i>dum</i>, <i>patter</i>, <i>patter</i>,

<p>&ldquo;No, mother deari, it was not a horse, for I am on a better,

260</span>IV.&nbsp; HOUSE GYPSIES IN PHILADELPHIA</h3>
<p>This chapter was written by my niece through marriage, Miss Elizabeth
Robins.&nbsp; It is a part of an article which was published in &ldquo;The
Century,&rdquo; and it sets forth certain wanderings in seeking old houses
in the city of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>All along the lower part of Race Street, saith the lady, are wholesale
stores and warehouses of every description.&nbsp; Some carts belonging to
one of them had just been unloaded.&nbsp; The stevedores who do
this&mdash;all negroes&mdash;were resting while they waited for the next
load.&nbsp; They were great powerful men, selected for their strength, and
were of many hues, from <i>caf&eacute; au lait</i>, or coffee much milked,
up to the browned or black-scorched berry itself, while the very
<i>athlet&aelig;</i> were coal-black.&nbsp; They wore blue overalls, and on
their heads they had thrown old coffee-bags, which, resting on their
foreheads, passed behind their ears and hung loosely down their
backs.&nbsp; It was in fact the <i>haik</i> or bag-cloak of the East, and
it made a wonderfully effective Arab costume.&nbsp; One of them was half
leaning, half sitting, on a pile of bags; his Herculean arms were folded,
and he had unconsciously assumed an air of dignity and defiance.&nbsp; He
might have passed for an African chief.&nbsp; When we see such men in Egypt
or other sunny countries <i>outre mer</i>, we become artistically eloquent;
but it rarely occurs <!-- page 261--><a name="page261"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 261</span>to sketchers and word-painters to do much
business in the home-market.</p>
<p>The mixture of races in our cities is rapidly increasing, and we hardly
notice it.&nbsp; Yet it is coming to pass that a large part of our
population is German and Irish, and that our streets within ten years have
become fuller of Italian fruit dealers and organ-grinders, so that <i>Cives
sum Romanus</i> (I am a Roman citizen), when abroad, now means either
&ldquo;I possess a monkey&rdquo; or &ldquo;I sell pea-nuts.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Jews from Jerusalem peddle pocket-books on our sidewalks, Chinamen are
monoplizing our washing and ironing, while among laboring classes are
thousands of Scandinavians, Bohemians, and other Slaves.&nbsp; The prim
provincial element which predominated in my younger years is yielding
before this influx of foreigners, and Quaker monotony and stern
conservatism are vanishing, while Philadelphia becomes year by year more
cosmopolite.</p>
<p>As we left the handsome negroes and continued our walk on Water Street
an Italian passed us.&nbsp; He was indeed very dirty and dilapidated; his
clothes were of the poorest, and he carried a rag-picker&rsquo;s bag over
his shoulder; but his face, as he turned it towards us, was really
beautiful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Siete Italiano</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; (Are you an Italian?) asked
my uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Si</i>, <i>signore</i>&rdquo;&nbsp; (Yes, sir), he answered,
showing all his white teeth, and opening his big brown eyes very wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>E come lei piace questo paese</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; (And how do
you like this country?)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all.&nbsp; It is too cold,&rdquo; was his frank answer,
and laughing good-humoredly he continued his search through the
gutters.&nbsp; He would have made a good <!-- page 262--><a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>model for an artist,
for he had what we do not always see in Italians, the real southern beauty
of face and expression.&nbsp; Two or three weeks after this encounter, we
were astonished at meeting on Chestnut Street a little man, decently
dressed, who at once manifested the most extraordinary and extravagant
symptoms of delighted recognition.&nbsp; Never saw I mortal so grin-full,
so bowing.&nbsp; As we went on and crossed the street, and looked back, he
was waving his hat in the air with one hand, while he made gestures of
delight with the other.&nbsp; It was the little Italian rag-picker.</p>
<p>Then along and afar, till we met a woman, decently enough dressed, with
jet-black eyes and hair, and looking not unlike a gypsy.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
Romany!&rdquo; I cried with delight.&nbsp; Her red shawl made me think of
gypsies, and when I caught her eye I saw the indescrible flash of the
<i>k&#257;lorat</i>, or black blood.&nbsp; It is very curious that Hindus,
Persians, and gypsies have in common an expression of the eye which
distinguishes them from all other Oriental races, and chief in this
expression is the Romany.&nbsp; Captain Newbold, who first investigated the
gypsies of Egypt, declares that, however disguised, he could always detect
them by their glance, which is unlike that of any other human being, though
something resembling it is often seen in the ruder type of the rural
American.&nbsp; I believe myself that there is something in the gypsy eye
which is inexplicable, and which enables its possessor to see farther
through that strange mill-stone, the human soul, than I can explain.&nbsp;
Any one who has ever seen an old fortune-teller of &ldquo;the people&rdquo;
keeping some simple-minded maiden by the hand, while she holds her by her
glittering eye, like the Ancient Mariner, with a basilisk stare, will agree
with me.&nbsp; As Scheele de <!-- page 263--><a name="page263"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 263</span>Vere writes, &ldquo;It must not be forgotten
that the human eye has, beyond question, often a power which far transcends
the ordinary purposes of sight, and approaches the boundaries of
magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But one glance, and my companion whispered, &ldquo;Answer me in Romany
when I speak, and don&rsquo;t seem to notice her.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, in
loud tone, he remarked, while looking across the street,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Adovo&rsquo;s a kushto puro rinkeno k&eacute;r
adoi</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; (That is a nice old pretty house there.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Avali</i>, <i>rya</i>&rdquo;&nbsp; (Yes, sir), I replied.</p>
<p>There was a perceptible movement by the woman in the red shawl to keep
within ear-shot of us.&nbsp; Mine uncle resumed,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Boro kushto covva se ta rakker a jib te kek Gorgio
iinella</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; (It&rsquo;s nice to talk a language that no
Gentile knows.)</p>
<p>The red shawl was on the trail.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Je crois que &ccedil;a
mord</i>,&rdquo; remarked my uncle.&nbsp; We allowed our artist guide to
pass on, when, as I expected, I felt a twitch at my outer garment.&nbsp; I
turned, and the witch eyes, distended with awe and amazement, were glaring
into mine, while she said, in a hurried whisper,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it Romanes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Avah</i>,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;<i>mendui rakker sarja
adovo jib</i>.&nbsp; <i>B&#363;tik&#363;mi ryeskro lis se denna
Gorgines</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Yes, we always talk that language.&nbsp; Much
more genteel it is than English.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Te adovo wavero rye</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; (And that <i>other</i>
gentleman?) with a glance of suspicion at our artist friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sar tacho</i>&rdquo; (He&rsquo;s all right), remarked mine
uncle, which I greatly fear meant, when correctly translated in a Christian
sense, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s all wrong.&rdquo;&nbsp; But there <!-- page
264--><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>is a natural
sympathy and intelligence between Bohemians of every grade, all the world
over, and I never knew a gypsy who did not understand an artist.&nbsp; One
glance satisfied her that he was quite worthy of our society.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where are you <i>tannin kenn&#257;</i>?&rdquo; (tenting now),
I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not tenting at this time of year; we&rsquo;re
<i>kairin</i>,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, houseing, or home-ing.&nbsp; It is a
good verb, and might be introduced into English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where is your house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, right by Mammy Sauerkraut&rsquo;s Row.&nbsp; Come in and
sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I need not give the Romany which was spoken, but will simply
translate.&nbsp; The house was like all the others.&nbsp; We passed through
a close, dark passage, in which lay canvas and poles, a kettle and a
<i>sarshta</i>, or the iron which is stuck into the ground, and by which a
kettle hangs.&nbsp; The old-fashioned tripod, popularly supposed to be used
by gypsies, in all probability never existed, since the Roms of India
to-day use the <i>sarshta</i>, as mine uncle tells me he learned from a
<i>ci-devant</i> Indian gypsy Dacoit, or wandering thief, who was one of
his intimates in London.</p>
<p>We entered an inner room, and I was at once struck by its general
indescribable unlikeness to ordinary rooms.&nbsp; Architects declare that
the type of the tent is to be distinctly found in all Chinese and Arab or
Turkish architecture; it is also as marked in a gypsy&rsquo;s
house&mdash;when he gets one.&nbsp; This room, which was evidently the
common home of a large family, suggested, in its arrangement of furniture
and the manner in which its occupants sat around the tent and the
wagon.&nbsp; There was a bed, it is true <!-- page 265--><a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>but there was a roll
of sail-cloth, which evidently did duty for sleeping on at night, but which
now, rolled up, acted the part described by Goldsmith:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A thing contrived a double part to play,<br />
A bed by night, a sofa during day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was one chair and a saddle, a stove and a chest of drawers.&nbsp;
I observed an engraving hanging up which I have several times seen in gypsy
tents.&nbsp; It represents a very dark Italian youth.&nbsp; It is a
favorite also with Roman Catholics, because the boy has a consecrated
medal.&nbsp; The gypsies, however, believe that the boy stole the
medal.&nbsp; The Catholics think the picture is that of a Roman boy,
because the inscription says so; and the gypsies call it a Romany, so that
all are satisfied.&nbsp; There were some eight or nine children in the
room, and among them more than one whose resemblance to the dark-skinned
saint might have given color enough to the theory that he was</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &ldquo;One whose blood<br />
Had rolled through gypsies ever since the flood.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was also a girl, of the pantherine type, and one damsel of about
ten, who had light hair and fair complexion, but whose air was gypsy and
whose youthful countenance suggested not the golden, but the brazenest, age
of life.&nbsp; Scarcely was I seated in the only chair, when this little
maiden, after keenly scrutinizing my appearance, and apparently taking in
the situation, came up to me and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yer come here to have yer fortune told.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell it
to yer for five cents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Can tute pen dukkerin aja</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; (Can you tell
fortunes already?) I inquired.&nbsp; And if that damsel had been lifted at
that instant by the hair into the infinite <!-- page 266--><a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>glory of the seventh
sphere, her countenance could not have manifested more amazement.&nbsp; She
stood <i>bouche beante</i>, stock still staring, open-mouthed wide.&nbsp; I
believe one might have put a brandy ball into it, or a &ldquo;bull&rsquo;s
eye,&rdquo; without her jaws closing on the dainty.&nbsp; It was a stare of
twenty-four carats, and fourth proof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This here <i>rye</i>&rdquo; remarked mine uncle, affably, in
middle English, &ldquo;is a hartist.&nbsp; He puts &rsquo;is heart into all
he does; <i>that&rsquo;s</i> why.&nbsp; He ain&rsquo;t Romanes, but he may
be trusted.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s come here, that wot he has, to draw this
&rsquo;ere Mammy Sauerkraut&rsquo;s Row, because it&rsquo;s
interestin&rsquo;.&nbsp; He ain&rsquo;t a tax-gatherer.&nbsp; <i>We</i>
don&rsquo;t approve o&rsquo; payin&rsquo; taxes, none of hus.&nbsp; We
practices heconomy, and dislike the po-lice.&nbsp; Who was Mammy
Sauerkraut?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know!&rdquo; cried the youthful would-be fortune-teller.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She was a witch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Tool yer chib</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; (Hold your tongue!) cried the
parent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother the lady with stories about
<i>chovihanis</i>&rdquo; (witches).</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s just what I want to hear!&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Go on, my little dear, about Mammy Sauerkraut, and you will get your
five cents yet, if you only give me enough of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, Mammy Sauerkraut was a witch, and a little black girl
who lives next door told me so.&nbsp; And Mammy Sauerkraut used to change
herself into a pig of nights, and that&rsquo;s why they called her
Sauerkraut.&nbsp; This was because they had pig ketchers going about in
those times, and once they ketched a pig that belonged to her, and to be
revenged on them she used to look like a pig, and they would follow her
clear out of town way up the river, and <!-- page 267--><a
name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>she&rsquo;d run, and
they&rsquo;d run after her, till by and by fire would begin to fly out of
her bristles, and she jumped into the river and sizzed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This I thought worthy of the five cents.&nbsp; Then my uncle began to
put questions in Romany.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Anselo W.?&nbsp; He that was <i>staruben</i> for a
<i>gry</i>?&rdquo; (imprisoned for a horse).</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Staruben apopli</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Imprisoned again.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry for it, sister Nell.&nbsp; He used to play the fiddle
well.&nbsp; I wot he was a canty chiel&rsquo;, and dearly lo&rsquo;ed the
whusky, oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he was too fond of that.&nbsp; How well he could
play!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said my uncle, &ldquo;he could.&nbsp; And I have sung
to his fiddling when the <i>tatto-p&#257;ni</i> [hot water, <i>i.e.</i>,
spirits] boiled within us, and made us gay, oh, my golden sister!&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s the way we Hungarian gypsy gentlemen always call the ladies of
our people.&nbsp; I sang in Romany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to hear you sing now,&rdquo; remarked a dark,
handsome young man, who had just made a mysterious appearance out of the
surrounding shadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a <i>kamaben gilli</i>&rdquo; (a love-song), said the
<i>rye</i>; &ldquo;and it is beautiful, deep old Romanes,&mdash;enough to
make you cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was the long sound of a violin, clear as the note of a horn.&nbsp;
I had not observed that the dark young man had found one to his hand, and,
as he accompanied, my uncle sang; and I give the lyric as he afterwards
gave it to me, both in Romany and English.&nbsp; As he frankly admitted, it
was his own composition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that <i>is</i> deep Romanes,&rdquo; said the woman,
admiringly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> should think it was,&rdquo; remarked the
violinist.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, I didn&rsquo;t understand more than one half
of it.&nbsp; But what I caught I understood.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which, I
reflected, as he uttered it, is perhaps exactly the case with far more than
half the readers of all poetry.&nbsp; They run on in a semi-sensuous mental
condition, soothed by cadence and lulled by rhyme, reading as they run for
want of thought.&nbsp; Are there not poets of the present day who mean that
you shall read them thus, and who cast their gold ornaments hollow, as
jewelers do, lest they should be too heavy?</p>
<p>&ldquo;My children,&rdquo; said Meister Karl, &ldquo;I could go on all

man.&nbsp; &ldquo;When a <i>rye&rsquo;s</i> a Rom he&rsquo;s anywhere at

<p>&ldquo;So <i>kushto bak</i>!&rdquo; (Good luck!) I said, rising to
go.&nbsp; &ldquo;We will come again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we will come again,&rdquo; said Meister Karl.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Look for me with the roses at the races, and tell me the horse to

witches, sister of the stars, daughter of darkness, farewell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This bewildering speech was received with admiring awe, and we
departed.&nbsp; I should have liked to hear the comments on us which passed
that evening among the gypsy denizens of Mammy Sauerkraut&rsquo;s Row.</p>
<h3><!-- page 272--><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>V.&nbsp; A GYPSY LETTER.</h3>
<p>All the gypsies in the country are not upon the roads.&nbsp; Many of
them live in houses, and that very respectably, nay, even
aristocratically.&nbsp; Yea, and it may be, O reader, that thou hast met
them and knowest them not, any more than thou knowest many other deep
secrets of the hearts and lives of those who live around thee.&nbsp; Dark
are the ways of the Romany, strange his paths, even when reclaimed from the
tent and the van.&nbsp; It is, however, intelligible enough that the Rom
converted to the true faith of broadcloth garments by Poole, or dresses by
Worth, as well as to the holy gospel of daily baths and <i>savon au
violet</i>, should say as little as possible of his origin.&nbsp; For the
majority of the world being snobs, they continually insist that all blood
unlike their own is base, and the child of the <i>k&#257;lorat</i>, knowing
this, sayeth naught, and ever carefully keeps the lid of silence on the pot
of his birth.&nbsp; And as no being that ever was, is, or will be ever
enjoyed holding a secret, playing a part, or otherwise entering into the
deepest mystery of life&mdash;which is to make a joke of it&mdash;so
thoroughly as a gypsy, it follows that the being respectable has to him a
raciness and drollery and pungency and point which passeth faith.&nbsp; It
has often occurred to me, and the older I grow the more I find it true,
that the <i>real</i> pleasure which bank presidents, moral politicians,
<!-- page 273--><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span>not a few clergymen, and most other highly representative good
men take in having a high character is the exquisite secret consciousness
of its being utterly undeserved.&nbsp; They love acting.&nbsp; Let no man
say that the love of the drama is founded on the artificial or sham.&nbsp;
I have heard the Reverend Histriomastix war and batter this on the pulpit;
but the utterance <i>per se</i> was an actual, living lie.&nbsp; He was
acting while he preached.&nbsp; Love or hunger is not more an innate
passion than acting.&nbsp; The child in the nursery, the savage by the
Nyanza or in Alaska, the multitude of great cities, all love to bemask and
seem what they are not.&nbsp; Crush out carnivals and masked balls and
theatres, and lo, you! the disguising and acting and masking show
themselves in the whole community.&nbsp; Mawworm and Aminidab Sleek then
play a r&ocirc;le in every household, and every child becomes a wretched
little Roscius.&nbsp; Verily I say unto you, the fewer actors the more
acting; the fewer theatres the more stages, and the worse.&nbsp; Lay it to
heart, study it deeply, you who believe that the stage is an open door to
hell, for the chances are ninety and nine to one that if this be true
<i>you</i> will end by consciously or unconsciously keeping a private
little gate thereunto.&nbsp; Beloved, put this in thy pipe and fumigate it,
that acting in some form is a human instinct which cannot be extinguished,
which never has been and never will be; and this being so, is it not
better, with Dr. Bellows, to try to put it into proper form than to crush
it?&nbsp; Truly it has been proved that with this, as with a certain other
unquenchable penchant of humanity, when you suppress a score of
professionals you create a thousand zealous amateurs.&nbsp; There was never
in this world a stage on which mere acting was <!-- page 274--><a
name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>more skillfully
carried out than in all England under Cromwell, or in Philadelphia under
the Quakers.&nbsp; Eccentric dresses, artificial forms of language,
separate and &ldquo;peculiar&rdquo; expressions of character unlike those
of &ldquo;the world,&rdquo; were all only giving a form to that craving for
being odd and queer which forms the soul of masking and acting.&nbsp; Of
course people who act all the time object to the stage.&nbsp; <i>Le diable
ne veut pas de miroir</i>.</p>
<p>The gypsy of society not always, but yet frequently, retains a keen
interest in his wild ancestry.&nbsp; He keeps up the language; it is a
delightful secret; he loves now and then to take a look at &ldquo;the old
thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Closely allied to the converted sinners are the
<i>aficionados</i>, or the ladies and gentlemen born with unconquerable
Bohemian tastes, which may be accounted for by their having been themselves
gypsies in pre&euml;xistent lives.&nbsp; No one can explain how or why it
is that the <i>aficion</i> comes upon them.&nbsp; It is <i>in</i>
them.&nbsp; I know a very learned man in England, a gentleman of high
position, one whose name is familiar to my readers.&nbsp; He could never
explain or understand why from early childhood he had felt himself drawn
towards the wanderers.&nbsp; When he was only ten years old he saved up all
his little store of pence wherewith to pay a tinker to give him lessons in
Romany, in which tongue he is now a Past Grand.&nbsp; I know ladies in
England and in America, both of the blood and otherwise, who would give up
a ball of the highest flight in society, to sit an hour in a gypsy tent,
and on whom a whispered word of Romany acts like wild-fire.&nbsp; Great as
my experience has been I can really no more explain the intensity of this
yearning, this <i>rapport</i>, than I can fly.&nbsp; My own fancy for
gypsydom is faint and feeble compared <!-- page 275--><a
name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>to what I have found
in many others.&nbsp; It is in them like the love for opium, for music, for
love itself, or for acting.&nbsp; I confess that there is to me a nameless
charm in the strangely, softly flowing language, which gives a sweeter
sound to every foreign word which it adopts, just as the melody of a forest
stream is said to make more musical the songs of the birds who dwell beside
it.&nbsp; Thus Wentzel becomes Wenselo and Anselo; Arthur, Artaros; London,
Lundra; Sylvester, Westaros.&nbsp; Such a phrase as &ldquo;<i>Dordi</i>!
<i>dovelo adoi</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; (See! what is that there?) could not be
surpassed for mere beauty of sound.</p>
<p>It is apropos of living double lives, and playing parts, and the charm
of stealing away unseen, like naughty children, to romp with the tabooed
offspring of outlawed neighbors, that I write this, to introduce a letter
from a lady, who has kindly permitted me to publish it.&nbsp; It tells its
own story of two existences, two souls in one.&nbsp; I give it as it was
written, first in Romany, and then in English:&mdash;</p>

<p>TRANSLATION.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>February</i> 1<i>st</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,&mdash;You will be glad to
learn that I, within the week, found a real Romany family (place) here in
this town.&nbsp; Charming it was to find our folk again; pleasant it was to
listen to our tongue.&nbsp; The Lord be on me! but I was half sick of
Gentiles and their ways till this occurred.&nbsp; The other day, as I was
returning from a highly aristocratic breakfast, where we had winter
strawberries with the <i>cr&ecirc;me de la cr&ecirc;me</i>, I saw two gypsy
women sitting on a bench in --- Square.&nbsp; Black eyes, black hair, red
kerchiefs on their heads, their baskets on the ground before their
feet.&nbsp; Dear Lord! but I was half wild with delight at seeing
them.&nbsp; Aye, I made the coachman stop the horses, and cried aloud,
&ldquo;Come here!&rdquo;&nbsp; They thought I was a lady to fortune-tell,
and came quickly.&nbsp; But I laughed, and said in Romany, &ldquo;How are
you, my dears?&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t <!-- page 279--><a
name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>know that I am a
gypsy.&rdquo;&nbsp; They could not trust their very ears or eyes!&nbsp; At
length one said, &ldquo;My God! what <i>is</i> your name?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Britannia Lee,&rdquo; and, at a glance, they saw
that I was to be trusted, and a Romany.&nbsp; Their names, they said, were
M. and D.&nbsp; It was hard (far) for them to understand how a Romany lady
<i>could</i> live among Gentiles, and look so Gorgious, and yet be a true
gypsy withal, and proud of her dark blood.&nbsp; Much they talked about our
people; much news I heard,&mdash;much as to who was married and born and
buried, who was come from the old country, and much more.&nbsp; Oh,
<i>never</i> was such news so sweet to me!&nbsp; M. said, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know how you <i>can</i> live among the Gentiles.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
answered, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t live; I <i>die</i>, living in their houses
with them.&rdquo;&nbsp; They begged me then to come and see them in their
home, upon the hill, where they are wintering.&nbsp; M. said, &ldquo;Come,
my sister, and eat a little with us.&nbsp; You know that the women are only
at home at night and on Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sunday morning, sister and I went there, and found the house.&nbsp; It
was a little place, but, as they said, after the life in wagons it seemed
large.&nbsp; M. was there, and her husband&rsquo;s mother, a nice old
woman; also A., with four children.&nbsp; M. was cooking as we
entered.&nbsp; The old mother was glad to see us; she wished to know all
about us.&nbsp; All talked, indeed, and that quite rapidly, and she said
that I was the first Romany lady <a name="citation279"></a><a
href="#footnote279" class="citation">[279]</a> she had ever seen.&nbsp; I
said to her that in society are many gypsy ladies to be found, but that the
wretched Gentiles do not know it.</p>
<p>She said that my sister looked like Lusha Cooper, and showed her dark
blood more than I do.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t favor the Coopers, my
dearie.&nbsp; You say your mother married a Smith.&nbsp; Was that the Smith
who kept a dancing and boxing <!-- page 280--><a name="page280"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 280</span>place near London Bridge?&nbsp; Were you born
in England?&rdquo;&nbsp; I told the old mother all I knew about myself and
my relations.&nbsp; You know that no Gorgios are so long-winded on
genealogies as old mothers in Rom.&nbsp; When people don&rsquo;t write them
down in their family Bibles, they carry them, extended, in their
heads.&nbsp; <i>Que la main droit perd recueille la gauche</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know any of the ---&rsquo;s?&rdquo; said M.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You look like ---&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No; she&rsquo;s
too pale,&rdquo; said A.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something in the look of
her,&rdquo; said M.</p>
<p>Reflect, my brother.&nbsp; You know that --- was the woman who
&ldquo;cleaned out&rdquo; a man named --- of a very large sum <a
name="citation280"></a><a href="#footnote280" class="citation">[280]</a> by
&ldquo;dukkeripen&rdquo; and &ldquo;dudikabin.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;When she
was arrested, the justice made her dress like any Gorgio, and placed her
among twelve Gentile women.&nbsp; The man who had been robbed was to point
out who among them had stolen his money.&nbsp; When she came into the room,
he went at once to her, and said, &lsquo;I know her by her long skinny
fingers and handsome face.&rsquo;&nbsp; She was imprisoned for two years,
but the Gorgio never recovered his money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What time we reasoned thus, the door undid, and three men entered.&nbsp;
After their greetings, M. cried, &ldquo;Come to table; bring your chairs
with you!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Mrs. Lee, why didn&rsquo;t you bring your
husband?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Because I am not married.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lord!&nbsp; Britannia!&nbsp; Why, M. told me that you
were.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, M. didn&rsquo;t fortune right when she
fortuned that.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a fool,&rdquo; quoth I.&nbsp; And then we
all laughed like children.&nbsp; The food was good: chickens and ham and
fried potatoes, with a glass of sound ale.&nbsp; We were gay as flies in
summer, in the real old Romany way.&nbsp; &rsquo;T was
&ldquo;Britannia&rdquo; here, &ldquo;Britannia&rdquo; there, as in the
merry days when we were young.&nbsp; Little do I believe in Dante&rsquo;s
words,&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 281--><a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>&ldquo;Nessun maggior dolore,<br />
Che ricordarsi dei tempi felici.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no greater grief<br />
Than to remember by-gone happy days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For it is always happiness to me to think of good old times when I was
glad.&nbsp; All drank my health, <i>Romaneskaes</i>, together, with a
shout,&mdash;all save H., who said he had already had too much.&nbsp;
Good-looking gypsy, that!&nbsp; You&rsquo;d know him anywhere for Romany,
he is so dark,&mdash;<i>avec l&rsquo;air ind&eacute;finissable du vrai
Bohemien</i>.&nbsp; He promised to drink my health another time.</p>
<p>As we sat, a gentleman came in below, wishing to have his fortune
told.&nbsp; I remember to have read that the Pythoness of Delphian oracle
prepared herself for <i>dukkerin</i>, or presaging, by taking a few drops
of cherry-laurel water.&nbsp; (I have had it prescribed for my eyes as R
<i>aq. laur. cerasi. fiat lotio</i>,&mdash;possibly to enable me to see
into the future.)&nbsp; Perhaps it was the cherry-brandy beloved of British
matrons and Brighton school-girls, taken at Mutton&rsquo;s.&nbsp; <i>Mais
revenons &agrave; nos moutons</i>.&nbsp; The old mother had taken, not
cherry-laurel water, nor even cherry-brandy, but joly good ale, and olde,
which, far from fitting her to reveal the darksome lore of futurity, had
rendered her loath to leave the festive board of the present.&nbsp;
Wrathful was the sybil, furious as the Vala when waked by Odin, angry as
Thor when he missed his hammer, to miss her merriment.&nbsp; &ldquo;May the
devil take the old dog for coming when we are eating, and when thou art
here, my Britannia!&nbsp; Little good fortune will he hear this day.&nbsp;
Evil shall be the best I&rsquo;ll promise him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus spake the
sorceress, and out she went to keep her word.&nbsp; Truly it was a splendid
picture this of &ldquo;The Enraged Witch,&rdquo; as painted by Hexenmeister
von Teufel, of H&ouml;llenstadt,&mdash;her viper eyes flashing infernal
light and most unchristian fire, shaking <i>les noirs serpents de ses
cheveux</i>, as she went forth.&nbsp; I know how, in an instant, her face
was beautiful with welcome, smiling like a Neapolitan at a cent; <!-- page
282--><a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>but the poor
believer caught it hot, all the same, and had a sleepless night over his
future fate.&nbsp; I wonder if the Pythoness of old, when summoned from a
<i>petit souper</i>, or a holy prophet called out of bed of a cold night,
to decide by royal command on the fate of Israel, ever &ldquo;took it
out&rdquo; on the untimely king by promising him a lively, unhappy time of
it.&nbsp; Truly it is fine to be behind the scenes and see how they work
the oracle.&nbsp; For the gentleman who came to consult my witch was a man
of might in the secrets of state, and one whom I have met in high
society.&nbsp; And, oh! <i>if</i> he had known who it was that was
up-stairs, laughing at him for a fool!</p>
<p>While she was forth, A. asked me, &ldquo;Do you tell fortunes, or
<i>what</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My sister,&rdquo; I replied,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell thee the truth.&nbsp; I do tell fortunes.&nbsp; I
keep a house for the purchase of stolen goods.&nbsp; I am largely engaged
in making counterfeit money and all kinds of forgery.&nbsp; I am interested
in burglary.&nbsp; I lie, swear, cheat, and steal, and get drunk on
Sunday.&nbsp; And I do many other things.&nbsp; I am a real Romany
witch.&rdquo;&nbsp; This little confession of faith brought down the
house.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bravo! bravo!&rdquo; they cried, laughing.</p>
<p>Sister and I had brought a great tipsy-cake for the children, and they
were all sitting under a table, eating it.&nbsp; It was a pretty
picture.&nbsp; I thought I saw in it myself and all my sisters and brothers
as we were once.&nbsp; Just such little gypsies and duckling Romanys!&nbsp;
And now!&nbsp; And then!&nbsp; What a comedy some lives are,&mdash;yea,
such lives as mine!&nbsp; And now it is <i>you</i> who are behind the
scenes; anon, I shall change with you.&nbsp; <i>Va Pierre</i>, <i>vient
Pierette</i>.&nbsp; Then I surprised a little brown maiden imp of five
summers stealing my beer, and as she was caught in the act, and tore away
shrieking with laughter, she looked, with her great black eyes and flowing
jetty curling locks, like a perfect little Bacchante.</p>
<p>Then we said, &ldquo;Thank you for the happy time!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Good <!-- page 283--><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>luck!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Good day!&rdquo; giving our promises to
come again.&nbsp; So we went home all well.&nbsp; I hope to see you at the
races here.&nbsp; Good luck and good-night also to you.</p>
<p>Always your friend,</p>

<p>I have somewhat abbreviated the Romany text of this letter, and Miss Lee
herself has somewhat polished and enlarged the translation, which is
strictly fit and proper, she being a very different person in English from
what she is in gypsy, as are most of her kind.&nbsp; This letter may be, to
many, a strange lesson, a quaint essay, a social problem, a fable, an
epigram, or a frolic,&mdash;just as they choose to take it.&nbsp; To me it
is a poem.&nbsp; Thou, my friend, canst easily understand why all that is
wild and strange, out-of-doors, far away by night, is worthy of being
Tennysoned or Whitmanned.&nbsp; If there be given unto thee stupendous
blasted trees, looking in the moonlight like the pillars of a vast and
ghostly temple; the fall of cataracts down awful rocks; the wind wailing in
wondrous language or whistling Indian melody all night on heath, rocks, and
hills, over ancient graves and through lonely caves, bearing with it the
hoot of the night-owl; while over all the stars look down in eternal
mystery, like eyes reading the great riddle of the night which thou knowest
not,&mdash;this is to thee like Ariel&rsquo;s song.&nbsp; To me and to us
there are men and women who are in life as the wild river and the
night-owl, as the blasted tree and the wind over ancient graves.&nbsp; No
man is educated until he has arrived at that state of thought when a
picture is quite the same as a book, an old gray-beard jug as a manuscript,
men, women, and children as libraries.&nbsp; It was but yester morn that I
read a cuneiform inscription <!-- page 284--><a name="page284"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 284</span>printed by doves&rsquo; feet in the snow,
finding a meaning where in by-gone years I should have seen only a quaint
resemblance.&nbsp; For in this by the <i>ornithomanteia</i> known of old to
the Chaldean sages I saw that it was neither from arrow-heads or wedges
which gave the letters to the old Assyrians.&nbsp; When thou art at this
point, then Nature is equal in all her types, and the city, as the forest,
full of endless beauty and piquancy,&mdash;<i>in s&aelig;cula
s&aelig;culorum</i>.</p>
<p>I had written the foregoing, and had enveloped and directed it to be
mailed, when I met in a lady-book entitled &ldquo;Magyarland&rdquo; with
the following passages:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The gypsy girl in this family was a pretty young woman, with
masses of raven hair and a clear skin, but, notwithstanding her neat dress
and civilized surroundings, we recognized her immediately.&nbsp; It is, in
truth, not until one sees the Romany translated to an entirely new form of
existence, and under circumstances inconsistent with their ordinary lives,
that one realizes how completely different they are from the rest of
mankind in form and feature.&nbsp; Instead of disguising, the garb of
civilization only enhances the type, and renders it the more
apparent.&nbsp; No matter what dress they may assume, no matter what may be
their calling, no matter whether they are dwellers in tents or houses, it
is impossible for gypsies to disguise their origin.&nbsp; Taken from their
customary surroundings, they become at once an anomaly and an anachronism,
and present such an instance of the absurdity of attempting to invert the
order of nature that we feel more than ever how utterly different they are
from the human race; that there is a key to their strange life which we do
not possess,&mdash;a secret free <!-- page 285--><a
name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>masonry that renders
them more isolated than the veriest savages dwelling in the African
wilds,&mdash;and a hidden mystery hanging over them and their origin that
we shall never comprehend.&nbsp; They are indeed a people so entirely
separate and distinct that, in whatever clime or quarter of the globe they
may be met with, they are instantly recognized; for with them forty
centuries of association with civilized races have not succeeded in
obliterating one single sign.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lady writer of &ldquo;Magyarland&rdquo; held in her hand all the
while, and knew it not, a beautiful primrose, which might have opened for
her the mysterious Romany cavern.&nbsp; On a Danube steamboat she saw a
little blind boy sitting all day all alone: only a little Slavonian peasant
boy, &ldquo;an odd, quaint little specimen of humanity, with loose brown
garments, cut precisely like those of a grown-up man, and his bits of feet
in little raw-hide moccasins.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, with a <!-- page
286--><a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>tender,
gentle heart she began to pet the little waif.&nbsp; And the captain told
her what the boy was.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is a <i>guslar</i>, or minstrel, as
they call them in Croatia.&nbsp; The Yougo-Slavs dedicate all male children
who are born blind, from infancy, to the Muses.&nbsp; As soon as they are
old enough to handle anything, a small mandolin is given them, which they
are taught to play; after which they are taken every day into the woods,
where they are left till evening to commune in their little hearts with
nature.&nbsp; In due time they become poets, or at any rate rhapsodists,
singing of the things they never saw, and when grown up are sent forth to
earn their livelihood, like the troubadours of old, by singing from place
to place, and asking alms by the wayside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not difficult for a Slav to become a poet; he takes in
poetic sentiment as a river does water from its source.&nbsp; The first
sounds he is conscious of are the words of his mother singing to him as she
rocks his cradle.&nbsp; Then, as she watches the dawning of intelligence in
his infant face, her mother language is that of poetry, which she
improvises at the moment, and though he never saw the flowers nor the
snow-capped mountains, nor the flowing streams and rivers, he describes
them out of his inner consciousness, and the influence which the varied
sounds of nature have upon his mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rock and river and greenwood tree, sweet-spiced spring flower, rustling
grass, and bird-singing nature and freedom,&mdash;this is the secret of the
poets&rsquo; song and of the Romany, and there is no other mystery in
either.&nbsp; He who sleeps on graves rises mad or a poet; all who lie on
the earth, which is the grave and cradle of nature, and who live <i>al
fresco</i>, understand gypsies <!-- page 287--><a name="page287"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 287</span>as well as my lady Britannia Lee.&nbsp; Nay,
when some natures take to the Romany they become like the Norman knights of
the Pale, who were more Paddyfied than the Paddies themselves.&nbsp; These
become leaders among the gypsies, who recognize the fact that one renegade
is more zealous than ten Turks.&nbsp; As for the &ldquo;mystery&rdquo; of
the history of the gypsies, it is time, sweet friends, that &rsquo;t were
ended.&nbsp; When we know that there is to-day, in India, a sect and set of
Vauriens, who are there considered Gipsissim&aelig;, and who call
themselves, with their wives and language and being, Rom, Romni, and
Romnipana, even as they do in England; and when we know, moreover, that
their faces proclaim them to be Indian, and that they have been a wandering
caste since the dawn of Hindu history, we have, I trow, little more to
seek.&nbsp; As for the rest, you may read it in the great book of Out-of
Doors, <i>capitulo nullo folio nigro</i>, or wherever you choose to open
it, written as distinctly, plainly, and sweetly as the imprint of a
school-boy&rsquo;s knife and fork on a mince-pie, or in the uprolled
rapture of the eyes of Britannia when she inhaleth the perfume of a fresh
bunch of Florentine violets.&nbsp; <i>Ite missa est</i>.</p>

288</span>GYPSIES IN THE EAST.</h2>
<p>Noon in Cairo.</p>
<p>A silent old court-yard, half sun and half shadow in which quaintly
graceful, strangely curving columns seem to have taken from long
companionship with trees something of their inner life, while the palms,
their neighbors, from long in-door existence, look as if they had in turn
acquired household or animal instincts, if not human sympathies.&nbsp; And
as the younger the race the more it seeks for poets and orators to express
in thought what it only feels, so these dumb pillars and plants found their
poet and orator in the fountain which sang or spoke for them strangely and
sweetly all night and day, uttering for them not only their waking
thoughts, but their dreams.&nbsp; It gave a voice, too, to the ancient
Persian tiles and the Cufic inscriptions which had seen the caliphs, and it
told endless stories of Zobeide and Mesrour and Haroun al Raschid.</p>
<p>Beyond the door which, when opened, gave this sight was a dark ancient
archway twenty yards long, which opened on the glaring, dusty street, where
camels with their drivers and screaming <i>sais</i>, or carriage-runners
and donkey-boys and crying venders, kept up the wonted Oriental din.&nbsp;
But just within the archway, in its duskiest corner, there sat all day a
living picture, a dark and handsome woman, apparently <!-- page 289--><a
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>thirty years old, who
was unveiled.&nbsp; She had before her a cloth and a few shells; sometimes
an Egyptian of the lower class stopped, and there would be a grave
consultation, and the shells would be thrown, and then further solemn
conference and a payment of money and a departure.&nbsp; And it was
world-old Egyptian, or Chaldean, as to custom, for the woman was a
Rhagarin, or gypsy, and she was one of the diviners who sit by the wayside,
casting shells for auspices, even as shells and arrows were cast of old, to
be cursed by Israel.</p>
<p>It is not remarkable that among the myriad <i>manteias</i> of olden days
there should have been one by shells.&nbsp; The sound of the sea as heard
in the nautilus or conch, when</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It remembers its august abode<br />
And murmurs as the ocean murmurs there,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is very strange to children, and I can remember how in childhood I
listened with perfect faith to the distant roaring, and marveled at the
mystery of the ocean song being thus forever kept alive, inland.&nbsp;
Shells seem so much like work of human hands, and are often so marked as
with letters, that it is not strange that faith soon found the supernatural
in them.&nbsp; The magic shell of all others is the cowrie.&nbsp; Why the
Roman ladies called it <i>porcella</i>, or little pig, because it has a
pig&rsquo;s back, is the objective explanation of its name, and how from
its gloss that name, or porcellana, was transferred to porcelain, is in
books.&nbsp; But there is another side to the shell, and another or
esoteric meaning to &ldquo;piggy,&rdquo; which was also known to the
<i>dames du temps jadis</i>, to Archipiada and Thais, <i>qui fut la belle
Romaine</i>,&mdash;and this inner meaning makes of it a type of birth or
creation.&nbsp; <!-- page 290--><a name="page290"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 290</span>Now all that symbolizes fertility, birth,
pleasure, warmth, light, and love is opposed to barrenness, cold, death,
and evil; whence it follows that the very sight of a shell, and especially
of a cowrie, frightens away the devils as well as a horse-shoe, which by
the way has also its cryptic meaning.&nbsp; Hence it was selected to cast
for luck, a world-old custom, which still lingers in the game of props; and
for the same reason it is hung on donkeys, the devil being still scared
away by the sight of a cowrie, even as he was scared away of old by its
prototype, as told by Rabelais.</p>
<p>As the sibyls sat in caves, so the sorceress sat in the dark archway,
immovable when not sought, mysterious as are all her kind, and something to
wonder at.&nbsp; It was after passing her, and feeling by quick intuition
what she was, that the court-yard became a fairy-land, and the fountain its
poet, and the palm-trees Tamar maids.&nbsp; There are people who believe
there is no mystery, that an analysis of the gypsy sorceress would have
shown an ignorant outcast; but while nature gives chiaro-oscuro and beauty,
and while God is the Unknown, I believe that the more light there is cast
by science the more stupendous will be the new abysses of darkness
revealed.&nbsp; These natures must be taken with the <i>life</i> in them,
not dead,&mdash;and their life is mystery.&nbsp; The Hungarian gypsy lives
in an intense mystery, yes, in true magic in his singing.&nbsp; You may say
that he cannot, like Orpheus, move rocks or tame beasts with his
music.&nbsp; If he could he could do no more than astonish and move us, and
he does that now, and the <i>why</i> is as deep a mystery as that would
be.</p>
<p>So far is it from being only a degrading superstition in those who
believe that mortals like themselves <!-- page 291--><a
name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>can predict the
future, that it seems, on the contrary ennobling.&nbsp; It is precisely
because man feels a mystery within himself that he admits it may be higher
in others; if spirits whisper to him in dreams and airy passages of
trembling light, or in the music never heard but ever felt below, what may
not be revealed to others?&nbsp; You may tell me if you will that
prophecies are all rubbish and magic a lie, and it may be so,&mdash;nay,
<i>is</i> so, but the awful mystery of the Unknown without a name and the
yearning to penetrate it <i>is</i>, and is all the more, because I have
found all prophecies and jugglings and thaumaturgy fail to bridge over the
abyss.&nbsp; It is since I have read with love and faith the evolutionists
and physiologists of the most advanced type that the Unknown has become to
me most wonderful, and that I have seen the light which never shone on sea
or land as I never saw it before.&nbsp; And therefore to me the gypsy and
all the races who live in freedom and near to nature are more poetic than
ever.&nbsp; For which reason, after the laws of acoustics have fully
explained to me why the nautilus sounds like a far off-ocean dirge, the
unutterable longing <i>to know more</i> seizes upon me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Till my heart is full of longing<br />
&nbsp;  For the secret of the sea,<br />
And the heart of the great ocean<br />
&nbsp;  Sends a thrilling pulse through me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That gypsy fortune-teller, sitting in the shadow, is, moreover,
interesting as a living manifestation of a dead past.&nbsp; As in one of
her own shells when petrified we should have the ancient form without its
color, all the old elements being displaced by new ones, so we have the old
magic shape, though every atom in it is different; the same, yet not the
same <!-- page 292--><a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
292</span>Life in the future, and the divination thereof, was a stupendous,
ever-present reality to the ancient Egyptian, and the sole inspiration of
humanity when it produced few but tremendous results.&nbsp; It is when we
see it in such living forms that it is most interesting.&nbsp; As in
Western wilds we can tell exactly by the outline of the forests where the
borders of ancient inland seas once ran, so in the great greenwood of
history we can trace by the richness or absence of foliage and flower the
vanished landmarks of poetry, or perceive where the enchantment whose charm
has now flown like the snow of the foregone year once reigned in
beauty.&nbsp; So a line of lilies has shown me where the sea-foam once
fell, and pine-trees sang of masts preceding them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I sometimes think that never blows so red<br />
The rose as where some buried C&aelig;sar bled;<br />
That every hyacinth the garden wears<br />
Dropt in her lap from some once lovely head.&rdquo; <a
name="citation292"></a><a href="#footnote292"
class="citation">[292]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The memory of that court-yard reminds me that I possess two Persian
tiles, each with a story.&nbsp; There is a house in Cairo which is said to
be more or less contemporary with the prophet, and it is inhabited by an
old white-bearded emir, more or less a descendant of the prophet.&nbsp;
This old gentleman once gave as a precious souvenir to an American lady two
of the beautiful old tiles from his house, whereof I had one.&nbsp; In the
eyes of a Muslim there is a degree of sanctity attached to this tile, as
one on which the eyes of the prophet may have rested,&mdash;or at least the
eyes of those who were nearer to him than we are.&nbsp; Long after I
returned from Cairo I wrote and <!-- page 293--><a name="page293"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 293</span>published a fairy-book called Johnnykin, in
which occurred the following lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trust not the Ghoul, love,<br />
&nbsp;  Heed not his smile;<br />
<i>Out of the Mosque</i>, <i>love</i>,<br />
&nbsp;  <i>He stole the tile</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One day my friend the Palmer from over the sea came to me with a
present.&nbsp; It was a beautiful Persian tile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get it?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stole it out of a mosque in Syria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever read my Johnnykin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you never did.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here I repeated the
verse.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you remember what the Persian poet says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And never since the vine-clad earth was young<br />
Was some great crime committed on the earth,<br />
But that some poet prophesied the deed.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;True, and also what the great Tsigane poet sang:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O manush te lela sossi chored&oacute;,<br />
Wafodiro se te choramengr&oacute;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He who takes the stolen ring,<br />
Is worse than he who stole the thing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And it would have been better for you, while you were
<i>dukkerin</i> or prophesying, to have prophesied about something more
valuable than a tile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it came to pass that the two Persian tiles, one given by a
descendant of the Prophet, and the other the subject of a prophecy, rest in
my cabinet side by side.</p>
<p>In Egypt, as in Austria, or Syria, or Persia, or India, the gypsies are
the popular musicians.&nbsp; I had long <!-- page 294--><a
name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>sought for the
derivation of the word <i>banjo</i>, and one day I found that the Oriental
gypsies called a gourd by that name.&nbsp; Walking one day with the Palmer
in Cambridge, we saw in a window a very fine Hindu lute, or in fact a real
banjo made of a gourd.&nbsp; We inquired, and found that it belonged to a
mutual friend, Mr. Charles Brookfield, one of the best fellows living, and
who, on being forthwith &ldquo;requisitioned&rdquo; by the unanimous voice
of all who sympathized with me in my need, sent me the instrument.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He did not think it right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to keep it, when
Philology wanted it.&nbsp; If it had been any other party,&mdash;but he
always had a particular respect and awe of her.&rdquo;&nbsp; I do not
assert that this discovery settles the origin of the word <i>banjo</i>, but
the coincidence is, to say the least, remarkable.</p>
<p>I saw many gypsies in Egypt, but learned little from them.&nbsp; What I
found I stated in a work called the &ldquo;Egyptian Sketch
Book.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was to this effect: My first information was derived
from the late Khediv&eacute; Ismael, who during an interview with me said,
&ldquo;There are in Egypt many people known as Rhagarin, or Ghagarin, who
are probably the same as the gypsies of Europe.&nbsp; They are wanderers,
who live in tents, and are regarded with contempt even by the
peasantry.&nbsp; Their women tell fortunes, tattoo, and sell small wares;
the men work in iron.&nbsp; They are all adroit thieves, and noted as
such.&nbsp; The men may sometimes be seen going round the country with
monkeys.&nbsp; In fact, they appear to be in all respects the same people
as the gypsies of Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I habitually employed, while in Cairo, the same donkey-driver, an
intelligent and well-behaved man named Mahomet, who spoke English
fairly.&nbsp; On asking <!-- page 295--><a name="page295"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 295</span>him if he could show me any Rhagarin, he
replied that there was a fair or market held every Saturday at Boulac,
where I would be sure to meet with women of the tribe.&nbsp; The men, he
said, seldom ventured into the city, because they were subject to much
insult and ill-treatment from the common people.</p>
<p>On the day appointed I rode to Boulac.&nbsp; The market was very
interesting.&nbsp; I saw no European or Frangi there, except my companion,
Baron de Cosson, who afterwards traveled far into the White Nile country,
and who had with his brother Edward many remarkable adventures in
Abyssinia, which were well recorded by the latter in a book.&nbsp; All
around were thousands of blue-skirted and red-tarbouched or white-turbaned
Egyptians, buying or selling, or else amusing themselves, but with an
excess of outcry and hallo which indicates their grown child
character.&nbsp; There were dealers in donkeys and horses roaring aloud,
&ldquo;He is for ten napoleons!&nbsp; Had I asked twenty you would have
gladly given me fifteen!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;O true believers, here is a
Syrian steed which will give renown to the purchaser!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Strolling loosely about were dealers in sugar-cane and pea-nuts, which are
called gooba in Africa as in America, pipe peddlers and venders of
rosaries, jugglers and minstrels.&nbsp; At last we came to a middle-aged
woman seated on the ground behind a basket containing beads, glass armlets,
and such trinkets.&nbsp; She was dressed like any Arab-woman of the lower
class, but was not veiled, and on her chin blue lines were tattooed.&nbsp;
Her features and expression were, however, gypsy, and not Egyptian.&nbsp;
And as she sat there quietly I wondered how a woman could feel in her heart
who was looked down upon with infinite scorn by an Egyptian, who <!-- page
296--><a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>might justly
be looked down on in his turn with sublime contempt by an average American
Methodist colored whitewasher who &ldquo;took de
&lsquo;Ledger.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet there was in the woman the quiet
expression which associates itself with respectability, and it is worth
remarking that whenever a race is greatly looked down on by another from
the stand-point of mere color, as in America, or mere religion, as in
Mahometan lands, it always contains proportionally a larger number of
<i>decent</i> people than are to be found among those who immediately
oppress it.&nbsp; An average Chinese is as a human being far superior to a
hoodlum, and a man of color to the white man who cannot speak of him or to
him except as a &ldquo;naygur&rdquo; or a &ldquo;nigger.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
when a man realizes that he is superior in <i>nothing</i> else save race,
color, religion, family, inherited fortune, and their contingent advantages
that he develops most readily into the prig and snob.</p>
<p>I spoke to the woman in Romany, using such words as would have been
intelligible to any of her race in any other country; but she did not
understand me, and declared that she could speak nothing but Arabic.&nbsp;
At my request Mahomet explained to her that I had come from a distant
country in Orobba, or Europe, where there were many Rhagarin, who said that
their fathers came from Egypt, and that I wished to know if any in the old
country could speak the old language.&nbsp; She replied that the Rhagarin
of Montesinos could still speak it; but that her people in Egypt had lost
the tongue.&nbsp; Mahomet, in translating, here remarked that Montesinos
meant Mount Sinai or Syria.&nbsp; I then asked her if the Rhagarin had no
peculiar name for themselves, and she answered, &ldquo;Yes; we call
ourselves Tat&acirc;ren.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 297--><a name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
297</span>This at least was satisfactory.&nbsp; All over Southern Germany
and in Norway the gypsies are called Tartaren, and though the word means
Tartars, and is misapplied, it indicates the race.&nbsp; The woman seemed
to be much gratified at the interest I manifested in her people.&nbsp; I
gave her a double piaster, and asked for its value in blue glass
armlets.&nbsp; She gave me four, and as I turned to depart called me back,
and with a good-natured smile handed me four more as a present.&nbsp; This
generosity was very gypsy-like, and very unlike the habitual meanness of
the ordinary Egyptian.</p>
<p>After this Mahomet took me to a number of Rhagarin.&nbsp; They all
resembled the one whom I had seen, and all were sellers of small articles
and fortune-tellers.&nbsp; They all differed slightly from common Egyptians
in appearance, and were more unlike them in not being importunate for
money, nor disagreeable in their manners.&nbsp; But though they were as
certainly gypsies as old Charlotte Cooper herself, none of them could speak
Romany.&nbsp; I used to amuse myself by imagining what some of my English
gypsy friends would have done if turned loose in Cairo among their
cousins.&nbsp; How naturally old Charlotte would have waylaid and
&ldquo;dukkered&rdquo; and amazed the English ladies in the Muskee, and how
easily that reprobate old amiable cosmopolite, the Windsor Frog, would have
mingled with the motley mob of donkey-boys and tourists before
Shepherd&rsquo;s Hotel, and appointed himself an <i>attach&eacute;</i> to
their excursions to the Pyramids, and drunk their pale ale or anything else
to their healths, and then at the end of the day have claimed a wage for
his politeness!&nbsp; And how well the climate would have agreed with them,
and how they would have agreed that it was of all lands the best for
<i>tannin</i>, or tenting out, in the world!</p>
<p><!-- page 298--><a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
298</span>The gypsiest-looking gypsy in Cairo, with whom I became somewhat
familiar, was a boy of sixteen, a snake-charmer; a dark and even handsome
youth, but with eyes of such wild wickedness that no one who had ever seen
him excited could hope that he would ever become as other human
beings.&nbsp; I believe that he had come, as do all of his calling, from a
snake-catching line of ancestors, and that he had taken in from them, as
did Elsie Venner, the serpent nature.&nbsp; They had gone snaking,
generation after generation, from the days of the serpent worship of old,
it may be back to the old Serpent himself; and this tawny, sinuous, active
thing of evil, this boy, without the least sense of sympathy for any pain,
who devoured a cobra alive with as much indifference as he had just shown
in petting it, was the result.&nbsp; He was a human snake.&nbsp; I had long
before reading the wonderfully original work of Doctor Holmes reflected
deeply on the moral and immoral influences which serpent worship of old, in
Syria and other lands, must have had upon its followers.&nbsp; But Elsie
Venner sets forth the serpent nature as benumbed or suspended by cold New
England winters and New England religions, moral and social influences; the
Ophites of old and the Cairene gypsy showed the boy as warmed to life in
lands whose winters are as burning summers.&nbsp; Elsie Venner is not
sensual, and sensuality is the leading trait of the human-serpent
nature.&nbsp; Herein lies an error, just as a sculptor would err who should
present Lady Godiva as fully draped, or Sappho merely as a sweet singer of
Lesbos, or Antinous only as a fine young man.&nbsp; He who would harrow
hell and rake out the devil, and then exhibit to us an ordinary sinner, or
an <i>opera bouffe</i> &ldquo;Mefistofele,&rdquo; as the result, <!-- page
299--><a name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>reminds one
of the seven Suabians who went to hunt a monster,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>&auml;
Ungeheuer</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;and returned with a hare.&nbsp; Elsie Venner is
not a hare; she is a wonderful creation; but she is a winter-snake.&nbsp; I
confess that I have no patience, however, with those who pretend to show us
summer-snakes, and would fain dabble with vice; who are amateurs in the
diabolical, and drawing-room dilettanti in damnation.&nbsp; Such, as I have
said before, are the &aelig;sthetic adorers of Villon, whom the old
<i>rou&eacute;</i> himself would have most despised, and the admirers of
&ldquo;Faustine,&rdquo; whom Faustina would have picked up between her
thumb and finger, and eyed with serene contempt before throwing them out of
the window.&nbsp; A future age will have for these would-be wickeds, who
are only monks half turned inside out, more laughter than we now indulge in
at Chloe and Strephon.</p>
<p>I always regarded my young friend Abdullah as a natural child of the
devil and a serpent-souled young sinner, and he never disappointed me in my
opinion of him.&nbsp; I never in my life felt any antipathy to serpents,
and he evidently regarded me as a <i>sapengro</i>, or snake-master.&nbsp;
The first day I met him he put into my hands a cobra which had the fangs
extracted, and then handled an asp which still had its poison teeth.&nbsp;
On his asking me if I was afraid of it, and my telling him
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he gave it to me, and after I had petted it, he always
manifested an understanding,&mdash;I cannot say sympathy.&nbsp; I should
have liked to see that boy&rsquo;s sister, if he ever had one, and was not
hatched out from some egg found in the desert by an Egyptian incubus or
incubator.&nbsp; She must have been a charming young lady, and his mother
must have been a beauty, especially when in court-dress,&mdash;with <!--
page 300--><a name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 300</span>her
broom <i>et pr&aelig;terea nihil</i>.&nbsp; But neither, alas, could be
ever seen by me, for it is written in the &ldquo;Gittin&rdquo; that there
are three hundred species of male demons, but what the female herself is
like is known to no one.</p>
<p>Abdullah first made his appearance before me at Shepherd&rsquo;s Hotel,
and despite his amazing natural impudence, which appeared to such splendid
advantage in the street that I always thought he must be a lineal
descendant of the brazen serpent himself, he evinced a certain timidity
which was to me inexplicable, until I recalled that the big snake of Irish
legends had shown the same modesty when Saint Patrick wanted him to enter
the chest which he had prepared for his prison.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sure,
it&rsquo;s a nate little house I&rsquo;ve made for yees,&rdquo; said the
saint, &ldquo;wid an iligant parlor.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like
the look av it at all, at all,&rdquo; says the sarpent, as he squinted at
it suspiciously, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m loath to <i>inter</i> it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abdullah looked at the parlor as if he too were loath to
&ldquo;inter&rdquo; it; but he was in charge of one in whom his race
instinctively trust, so I led him in.&nbsp; His apparel was simple: it
consisted of a coarse shirt, very short, with a belt around the waist, and
an old tarbouch on his head.&nbsp; Between the shirt and his bare skin, as
in a bag, was about a half peck of cobras, asps, vipers, and similar
squirming property; while between his cap and his hair were generally
stowed one or two enormous living scorpions, and any small serpents that he
could not trust to dwell with the larger ones.&nbsp; When I asked Abdullah
where he contrived to get such vast scorpions and such lively serpents, he
replied, &ldquo;Out in the desert.&rdquo;&nbsp; I arranged, in fact, to go
out with him some day a-snaking and <!-- page 301--><a
name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>scorp&rsquo;ing, and
have ever since regretted that I did not avail myself of the
opportunity.&nbsp; He showed off his snakes to the ladies, and concluded by
offering to eat the largest one alive before our eyes for a dollar, which
price he speedily reduced to a half.&nbsp; There was a young New England
lady present who was very anxious to witness this performance; but as I
informed Abdullah that if he attempted anything of the kind I would kick
him out-of-doors, snakes and all, he ceased to offer to show himself a
cannibal.&nbsp; Perhaps he had learned what Rabbi Simon ben Yochai taught,
that it is a good deed to smash the heads of the best of serpents, even as
it is a duty to kill the best of Goyim.&nbsp; And if by Goyim he meant
Philistines, I agree with him.</p>
<p>I often met Abdullah after that, and helped him to several very good
exhibitions.&nbsp; Two or three things I learned from him.&nbsp; One was
that the cobra, when wide awake, yet not too violently excited, lifts its
head and maintains a curious swaying motion, which, when accompanied by
music, may readily be mistaken for dancing acquired from a teacher.&nbsp;
The Hindu <i>sappa-wallahs</i> make people believe that this
&ldquo;dancing&rdquo; is really the result of tuition, and that it is
influenced by music.&nbsp; Later, I found that the common people in Egypt
continue to believe that the snakes which Abdullah and his tribe exhibit
are as dangerous and deadly as can be, and that they are managed by
magic.&nbsp; Whether they believe, as it was held of old by the Rabbis,
that serpents are to be tamed by sorcery only on the Sabbath, I never
learned.</p>
<p>Abdullah was crafty enough for a whole generation of snakes, but in the
wisdom attributed to serpents he was woefully wanting.&nbsp; He would run
by my side <!-- page 302--><a name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
302</span>in the street as I rode, expecting that I would pause to accept a
large wiggling scorpion as a gift, or purchase a viper, I suppose for a
riding-whip or a necktie.&nbsp; One day when I was in a jam of about a
hundred donkey-boys, trying to outride the roaring mob, and all of a fever
with heat and dust, Abdullah spied me, and, joining the mob, kept running
by my side, crying in maddening monotony, &ldquo;Snake, sah!&nbsp;
Scorpion, sah!&nbsp; Very fine snake to-day, sah!&rdquo;&mdash;just as if
his serpents were edible delicacies, which were for that day particularly
fresh and nice.</p>
<p>There are three kinds of gypsies in Egypt,&mdash;the Rhagarin, the
Helebis, and the Nauar.&nbsp; They have secret jargons among themselves;
but as I ascertained subsequently from specimens given by Captain Newboldt
<a name="citation302a"></a><a href="#footnote302a"
class="citation">[302a]</a> and Seetzen, as quoted by Pott, <a
name="citation302b"></a><a href="#footnote302b" class="citation">[302b]</a>
their language is made up of Arabic &ldquo;back-slang,&rdquo; Turkish and
Greek, with a very little Romany,&mdash;so little that it is not wonderful
that I could not converse with them in it.&nbsp; The Syrian gypsies, or
Nuri, who are seen with bears and monkeys in Cairo, are strangers in the
land.&nbsp; With them a conversation is not difficult.&nbsp; It is
remarkable that while English, German, and Turkish or Syrian gypsy look so
different and difficult as printed in books, it is on the whole an easy
matter to get on with them in conversation.&nbsp; The roots being the same,
a little management soon supplies the rest.</p>
<p>Abdullah was a Helebi.&nbsp; The last time I saw him I was sitting on
the balcony of Shepherd&rsquo;s Hotel, in the early evening, with an
American, who had never seen a snake-charmer.&nbsp; I called the boy, and
inadvertently <!-- page 303--><a name="page303"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 303</span>gave him his pay in advance, telling him to
show all his stock in trade.&nbsp; But the temptation to swindle was too
great, and seizing the coin he rushed back into the darkness.&nbsp; From
that hour I beheld him no more.&nbsp; I think I can see that last gleam of
his demon eyes as he turned and fled.&nbsp; I met in after-days with other
snake-boys, but for an eye which indicated an unadulterated child of the
devil, and for general blackguardly behavior to match, I never found
anybody like my young friend Abdullah.</p>
<p>The last snake-masters whom I came across were two sailors at the
Oriental Seamen&rsquo;s Home in London.&nbsp; And strangely enough, on the
day of my visit they had obtained in London, of all places, a very large
and profitable job; for they had been employed to draw the teeth of all the
poisonous serpents in the Zoological Garden.&nbsp; Whether these
practitioners ever applied for or received positions as members of the
Dental College I do not know, any more than if they were entitled to
practice as surgeons without licenses.&nbsp; Like all the Hindu
<i>sappa-wallahs</i>, or snake-men, they are what in Europe would be called
gypsies.</p>

304</span>GYPSY NAMES AND FAMILY CHARACTERISTICS.</h2>
<p>The following list gives the names of the principal gypsy families in
England, with their characteristics.&nbsp; It was prepared for me by an
old, well-known Romany, of full blood.&nbsp; Those which have (<span
class="smcap">a</span>) appended to them are known to have representatives
in America.&nbsp; For myself, I believe that gypsies bearing all these
names are to be found in both countries.&nbsp; I would also state that the
personal characteristics attributed to certain families are by no means
very strictly applicable, neither do any of them confine themselves rigidly
to any particular part of England.&nbsp; I have met, for instance, with
Bosvilles, Lees, Coopers, Smiths, Bucklands, etc., in every part of England
as well as Wales.&nbsp; I am aware that the list is imperfect in all
respects.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ayres</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bailey (a)</span>.&nbsp; Half-bloods.&nbsp; Also
called rich.&nbsp; Roam in Sussex.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barton</span>.&nbsp; Lower Wiltshire.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Black</span>.&nbsp; Hampshire.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bosville (a)</span>.&nbsp; Generally spread, but are
specially to be found in Devonshire.&nbsp; I have found several fine
specimens of real Romanys among the American Bosvilles.&nbsp; In Romany,
<i>Chumomishto</i>, that is, Buss (or Kiss) well.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Broadway (a)</span>.&nbsp; Somerset.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Buckland</span>.&nbsp; In Gloucestershire, but
abounding over England.&nbsp; Sometimes called <i>Chokamengro</i>, that is
Tailor.</p>
<p><!-- page 305--><a name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p><span class="smcap">Gray</span>.&nbsp; Essex.&nbsp; In Romany,
<i>Gry</i>, or horse.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hare (a)</span>.&nbsp; Chiefly in Hampshire.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hazard</span>.&nbsp; Half-blood.&nbsp; Windsor.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Herne</span>.&nbsp; Oxfordshire and London.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of this name there are,&rdquo; says Borrow (Romano Lavo-Lil),
&ldquo;two gypsy renderings: (1.)&nbsp; Rosar-mescro or Ratzie-mescro, that
is, <i>duck</i>-fellow; the duck being substituted for the <i>heron</i>,
for which there is no word in Romany, this being done because there is a
resemblance in the sound of Heron and Herne.&nbsp; (2.)&nbsp; Balor-engre,
or Hairy People, the translator having confounded Herne with Haaren, Old
English for hairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hicks</span>.&nbsp; Half-blood.&nbsp; Berkshire.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hughes</span>.&nbsp; Wiltshire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones</span>.&nbsp; Half-blood.&nbsp; Headquarters
at Battersea, near London.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lee (a)</span>.&nbsp; The same in most respects as
the Smiths, but are even more widely extended.&nbsp; I have met with
several of the most decided type of pure-blooded, old-fashioned gypsies
among Lees in America.&nbsp; They are sometimes <!-- page 306--><a
name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>among themselves
called <i>purum</i>, a <i>lee-k</i>, from the fancied resemblance of the
words.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveridge</span>.&nbsp; Travel in Oxfordshire; are
in London at Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marshall</span>.&nbsp; As much Scotch as English,
especially in Dumfriesshire and Galloway, in which latter region, in Saint
Cuthbert&rsquo;s church-yard, lies buried the &ldquo;old man&rdquo; of the
race, who died at the age of one hundred and seven.&nbsp; In Romany
Makkado-tan-engree, that is, Fellows of the Marshes.&nbsp; Also known as
Bungoror, cork-fellows and Chikkenemengree, china or earthenware (lit. dirt
or clay) men, from their cutting corks, and peddling pottery, or mending
china.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Matthews</span>.&nbsp; Half-blood.&nbsp; Surrey.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">North</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Petulengro</span>, or <span
class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; The Romany name Petulengro means Master
of the Horseshoe; that is, Smith.&nbsp; The gypsy who made this list
declared that he had been acquainted with Jasper Petulengro, of
Borrow&rsquo;s Lavengro, and that he died near Norwich about sixty years
ago.&nbsp; The Smiths are general as travelers, but are chiefly to be found
in the East of England.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pike</span>.&nbsp; Berkshire.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pinfold</span>, or <span

extended, but most at home in London.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">R&oacute;llin</span> (<span
class="smcap">Roland</span>?).&nbsp; Half-blood.&nbsp; Chiefly about
London.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Scamp</span>.&nbsp; Chiefly in Kent.&nbsp; A small
clan.&nbsp; Mr. Borrow derives this name from the Sanskrit Ksump, to
go.&nbsp; I trust that it has not a more recent and purely English
derivation.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Shaw</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Small (a)</span>.&nbsp; Found in West England,
chiefly in Somerset and Devonshire.</p>
<p><!-- page 307--><a name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

extended clans, but said to be chiefly found in Devonshire.&nbsp; They
sometimes call themselves in joke Beshalay, that is, Sit-Down, from the
word <i>stan</i>, suggesting standing up in connection with lay.&nbsp; Also
Bangor, or Baromescre, that is, Stone (stan) people.&nbsp; Thus
&ldquo;Stony-lea&rdquo; was probably their first name.&nbsp; Also called
Kashtengrees, Woodmen, from the New Forest.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Taylor</span>.&nbsp; A clan described as

or Christian names of Romanys:&mdash;</p>
<h3>MASCULINE NAMES.</h3>
<p>Opi Boswell.</p>
<p>Wanselo, or Anselo.&nbsp; I was once of the opinion that this name was
originally Lancelot, but as Mr. Borrow has found Wentzlow, <i>i.e.</i>,
Wenceslas, in England, the latter is probably the original.&nbsp; I have
found it changed to Onslow, as the name painted on a Romany van in
Aberystwith, but it was pronounced Anselo.</p>
<p>Pastor-rumis.</p>
<p>Spico.</p>
<p>Jineral, <i>i.e.</i>, General Cooper.</p>
<p>Horferus and Horfer.&nbsp; Either Arthur or Orpheus.&nbsp; His name was
then changed to Wacker-doll, and finally settled into Wacker.</p>
<p>Plato or Platos Buckland.</p>
<p>Wine-Vinegar Cooper.&nbsp; The original name of the child bearing this
extraordinary name was Owen.&nbsp; He died soon after birth, and was in
consequence always spoken of as Wine-Vinegar,&mdash;Wine for the joy which
his parents had at his birth, and Vinegar to signify their grief at his
loss.</p>

<p>Vesuvius.&nbsp; I do not know whether any child was actually called by
this burning cognomen, but I remember that a gypsy, hearing two gentlemen
talking about Mount Vesuvius, was greatly impressed by the name, and
consulted with them as to the propriety of giving it to his little boy.</p>

<h3>MERLIN AND TRINALI.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;My uncle, tell me a pretty story!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, my child.&nbsp; I will tell you two, and perhaps three, if you keep
very quiet.&nbsp; Listen to me.&nbsp; Once in Wales there was a great
wizard named Merlin.&nbsp; Many magic things he could do.&nbsp; He knew how
to change one living being into another, iron into silver, and silver into
gold.&nbsp; A fine thing that would be if it were mine.&nbsp; And afar from
him lived a great witch.&nbsp; Trinali was her name.&nbsp; A great witch
was Trinali.&nbsp; Many men did she enchant, many gentlemen did she change
into asses and pigs, and never cared a copper for all their sufferings.</p>
<p>One day Merlin took his magic rod, and went afar to find the witch, and
pay her severely for all her wickedness.&nbsp; And on that very [true] day
the lady Trinali heard how Merlin was [is] a great, powerful wizard, and
said, &ldquo;What sort of a man is this?&nbsp; I will punish him or he
shall kill me, deuce help me!&nbsp; I will bewitch him.&nbsp; Let us see
who has the most cleverness and who is the most knowing.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
then Merlin went on the road all day alone, always in sunshine; and Trinali
went in the forest, always in the shade, the darkness, the gloom, for she
was a black witch.&nbsp; Soon they found one another, but Merlin did not
know [that] she was Trinali, and Trinal, <!-- page 315--><a
name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 315</span>did not know that man
was [is to be] Merlin.&nbsp; And he was very pleasant to her, and she to
him again.&nbsp; Very soon the two began to love one another very
much.&nbsp; When one knows that and the other knows it, both will soon know
it.&nbsp; Merlin and Trinali said &ldquo;I love thee&rdquo; both together,
and kissed one another, and sat down wrapped in the same cloak, and
conversed happily.</p>
<p>Then Merlin told her he was going to punish a very wicked witch; and
Trinali told him the same thing, how she was bold [daring] to do the same
thing to a great wizard.&nbsp; And the two began to beg one another to let
the thing go, and she and he were afraid of losing lover and
sweetheart.&nbsp; But Merlin said, &ldquo;I swore by the sun to change her
for her whole life into another form&rdquo; [body]; and she wept and said,
&ldquo;I swore by the moon to change that wizard into another [person] even
as you did.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Merlin inquired, &ldquo;What is his
name?&rdquo;&nbsp; She said, &ldquo;Merlin.&rdquo;&nbsp; He replied,
&ldquo;I am he; what is your name?&rdquo;&nbsp; She cried aloud,
&ldquo;Trinali.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now when witches swear anything on the sun or the moon, they must do it
or die.&nbsp; Then Merlin said, &ldquo;Do you know how to make this
business all nice and right?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not at all, my dear
love,&rdquo; said the poor witch, as she wept.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then I am
cleverer than you,&rdquo; said Merlin.&nbsp; &ldquo;An easy and nice thing
it is, my bride.&nbsp; For I will change you into me, and myself into
you.&nbsp; And when we are married we two will be one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So one man says nowadays that she conquered him, and another that he
conquered her.&nbsp; I do not know [which it was], my dear.&nbsp; Did you
ever see a two-headed halfpenny?&nbsp; <i>Yes</i>?&nbsp; Throw it up, and
<!-- page 316--><a name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
316</span>when it falls down ask me which side is under.&nbsp; A Welsher
told me that story.&nbsp; Welshers always tell the truth.</p>

317</span>THE SPIDER. </h3>
<p>Once there was a girl, as there are many to-day, and she was a good
needle-worker, and could make a beautiful cloak in one day.&nbsp; And that
[there] girl loved a gentleman very much; but one day her sweetheart was
shut up in prison, and when she heard it she hastened and went to the king,
and begged him humbly to let her love go free.&nbsp; And the king promised
her if she would make him a fine cloak,&mdash;one every day for a week,
seven cloaks for seven days,&mdash;he would forgive him, and give him leave
to go free.&nbsp; The young lady hastened to do it, and for six days she
worked hard [lit. pulled away] cheerfully at it, and always in the evening
she sent a cloak to the king.&nbsp; But it came [happened] one day that she
was tired, and said [that] she did not wish to work because it was rainy,
and she could not dry or bleach the cloth [?] in the sunlight.&nbsp; Then
the king said that if she could not work seven days to get her lover the
gentleman must remain imprisoned, for she did not love him as she should
[did not let love enough on him].&nbsp; And the maid was so angry and vexed
in her heart [or soul] that she died of grief, and was changed into a
spider.&nbsp; And to this day she spreads out her threads when the sun
shines, and the dew-drops which you see on them are the tears which she has
wept for her lover.</p>
<p>If you remain idle one summer day you may lose a whole week&rsquo;s
work, my dear.&nbsp; You say that you would like to hear more

<p>Once in the creation, when men had no names, the Lord went
walking.&nbsp; How was that?&nbsp; Listen, my child, I will sing it to
you:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many a year has passed away<br />
&nbsp;  Since the world was first begun,<br />

&nbsp;  To see how men&rsquo;s lives went on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As he walked along he saw three men by the roadside, waiting till some
man would give them names; and they asked the Lord to name them.&nbsp; See!
the first man was white, and the Lord called him Gorgio.&nbsp; Then he
adapted himself to that name, and adorned himself with jewelry and fine
clothes, and went <i>gorgeous</i>.&nbsp; And the other man was black and
the Lord called him Nigger, and he lounged away [<i>nikker</i>, to lounge,
loiter; an attempted pun], so idle and foul; and he is always lounging till
now in the sunshine, and he is too lazy [<i>kalo-kalo</i>, black-black, or
lazy-lazy, that is, too black or too lazy] to work unless you compel and
punish him.&nbsp; And the third man was brown, and he sat quiet, smoking
his pipe, till the Lord said, Rom! [gypsy, or &ldquo;roam&rdquo;]; and then
that man arose and said, very politely, &ldquo;Thank you, Lord, for your
kindness.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d be glad to drink your health.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he
went, Romany fashion, a-roaming <a name="citation319b"></a><a

321</span>FLINT AND STEEL.<br />
OR HOW THE SUN WAS CREATED.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me another story about the creation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was not there at the time, but I heard a great deal about it from my
grandfather.&nbsp; All he did there was to turn the wheel.&nbsp; People
tell me that the world was made from the sun, but gypsies, who do
everything all contrary, say that the sun was made from the earth.&nbsp; A
bad horse is that which will not travel either way on a road.&nbsp; Once in
the old time, as [there may be] now, was a great old witch, who made
enchantments, and lived all alone in the sky in the night.&nbsp; One day
she found a flint in a field, and picked her up, and the stone told her
that her name was Flint.&nbsp; And after a bit she found a small piece of
steel, and picked him up, and asked his name, and he replied,
&ldquo;Steel&rdquo; [iron].&nbsp; She put the two in her pocket, and said
to Flint, &ldquo;You must marry Master Steel.&rdquo;&nbsp; So they did, but
one day the two began to quarrel, and Steel gave his wife Flint a hot one
[a severe blow] in the eye, and made sparks fly, and set fire to the old
woman&rsquo;s pocket.&nbsp; So she threw the burning pocket up into the
sky, and told it to stay there until a man and his wife who had never
quarreled should come there.&nbsp; The sparks [from Flint&rsquo;s eye] are
the stars, and the fire is the sun, and it has not gone out as yet, and it
will burn on many a year, for all I know to the contrary.&nbsp; Is it
true?&nbsp; I was not there.</p>

323</span>THE MAN WHO LIVED IN THE MOON.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me another story about the moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, my dear.&nbsp; In the old time many men lived happily in the moon,
with nothing to do but keep up the fire which makes the light.&nbsp; But
among the folk lived a very wicked, obstinate man, who troubled and hated
all the other nice [dear] people, and he managed it so as to drive them all
away, and put them out of the moon.&nbsp; And when the mass of the folk
were gone, he said, &ldquo;Now those stupid dogs have gone, I will live
comfortably and well, all alone.&rdquo;&nbsp; But after a bit the fire
began to burn down, and that man found that if he did not want to be in the
darkness [night] and die of cold he must go all the time for wood.&nbsp;
And when the other people were there, they never did any carrying or
splitting wood in the day-time, but now he had to take it all on his
shoulders, all night and all day.&nbsp; So the people here on our earth see

If it&rsquo;s a big or a little thing, I&rsquo;ll tell the truth, so help
me God, upon my life!&nbsp; The devil be in my soul if I tell the least

and what do the gypsies do with the feathers, because nobody ever saw any
near a gypsy tent?&nbsp; Never, sir,&mdash;I <i>never</i> stole a chicken;
and in all the sixty years that I&rsquo;ve been on the roads, in all that

<h3>WITCHCRAFT. <a name="citation327"></a><a href="#footnote327"
class="citation">[327]</a></h3>
<p>&ldquo;My dear aunt, I wish very much to be a witch.&nbsp; I would like
to enchant people and to know secret things.&nbsp; You can teach me all
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my darling! if you come to be a witch, and the Gentiles know
it, you will have much trouble.&nbsp; All the children will cry aloud, and
make a noise and throw stones at you when they see you, and perhaps the
grown-up people will kill you.&nbsp; But it is nice to know secret things;
pleasant for a poor old humble woman whom all the world spits upon to know
how to do them evil and pay them for their cruelty.&nbsp; And I <i>will</i>
teach you something of witchcraft.&nbsp; Listen!&nbsp; <!-- page 328--><a
name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 328</span>When thou wilt tell a
fortune, put all thy heart into finding out what kind of a man or woman
thou hast to deal with.&nbsp; Look [keenly], fix thy glance sharply,
especially if it be a girl.&nbsp; When she is half-frightened, she will
tell you much without knowing it.&nbsp; When thou shalt have often done
this thou wilt be able to twist many a silly girl like twine around thy
fingers.&nbsp; Soon thy eyes will look like a snake&rsquo;s, and when thou
art angry thou wilt look like the old devil.&nbsp; Half the business, my
dear, is to know how to please and flatter and allure people.&nbsp; When a
girl has anything unusual in her face, you must tell her that it signifies
extraordinary luck.&nbsp; If she have red or yellow hair, tell her that is
a true sign that she will have much gold.&nbsp; When her eyebrows meet,
that shows she will be united to many rich gentlemen.&nbsp; Tell her
always, when you see a mole on her cheek or her forehead or anything, that
is a sign she will become a great lady.&nbsp; Never mind where it is, on
her body,&mdash;tell her always that a mole or fleck is a sign of
greatness.&nbsp; <i>Praise her up</i>.&nbsp; And if you see that she has
small hands or feet, tell her about a gentleman who is wild about pretty
feet, and how a pretty hand brings more luck than a pretty face.&nbsp;
Praising and petting and alluring and crying-up are half of
fortune-telling.&nbsp; There is no girl and no man in all the Lord&rsquo;s
earth who is not proud and vain about something, and if you can find it out
you can get their money.&nbsp; If you can, pick up all the gossip about
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my aunt, that is all humbug.&nbsp; I wish much to learn real
witchcraft.&nbsp; Tell me if there are no real witches, and how they
look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A real witch, my child, has eyes like a bird, the corner turned
up like the point of a curved pointed <!-- page 329--><a
name="page329"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 329</span>knife.&nbsp; Many
Jews and un-Christians have such eyes.&nbsp; And witches&rsquo; hairs are
drawn out from the beginning [roots] and straight, and then curled [at the
ends].&nbsp; When Gentile witches have green eyes they are the most [to be]
dreaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you something magical.&nbsp; When you find a pen or
an iron nail, and then a piece of paper, you should write on it with the
pen all thou wishest, and eat it, and thou wilt get thy wish.&nbsp; But
thou must write all in thy own blood.&nbsp; If thou findest by the sea a
great shell or an old pitcher [cup, etc.], put it to your ear: you will
hear a noise.&nbsp; If you can, when the full moon shines sit quite naked
in her light and listen to it; every night the noise will become more
distinct, and then thou wilt hear the fairies talking plainly enough.&nbsp;
When you make a hole with a stone in a tomb go there night after night, and
erelong thou wilt hear what the dead are saying.&nbsp; Often they tell
where money is buried.&nbsp; You must take a stone and turn it around in
the tomb till a hole is there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you something more witchly.&nbsp; Observe [take care]
of everything that swims on water, on rivers or the sea.&nbsp; For so the
water-spirits who live in the water speak to the earth&rsquo;s
witches.&nbsp; If a man sees cloth on the water and gets it, that shows he
will get a sweetheart; the cleaner and nicer the cloth, the better the
maid.&nbsp; If you find a staff [stick or rod] on the water, that shows you
will beat your enemy.&nbsp; A shoe or cup floating on the water means that
you will soon be loved by your sweetheart.&nbsp; And yellow flowers
[floating] on the water foretell gold, and white, silver, and red,
love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you find a key, that is much luck.&nbsp; When you pick [lift
it] up, utter a male or female name, <!-- page 330--><a
name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 330</span>and the person will
become your own.&nbsp; Very lucky is a red string or ribbon.&nbsp; Keep
it.&nbsp; It foretells happy love.&nbsp; Do not let this run away from thy
soul, my child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, aunt, never.&rdquo;</p>

331</span>THE ORIGIN OF THE GYPSIES.</h2>
<p>This chapter contains in abridged form the substance of papers on the
origin of the gypsies and their language, read before the London
Philological Society; also of another paper read before the Oriental
Congress at Florence in 1878; and a <i>resum&eacute;</i> of these published
in the London <i>Saturday Review</i>.</p>
<p>It has been repeated until the remark has become accepted as a sort of
truism, that the gypsies are a mysterious race, and that nothing is known
of their origin.&nbsp; And a few years ago this was true; but within those
years so much has been discovered that at present there is really no more
mystery attached to the beginning of these nomads than is peculiar to many
other peoples.&nbsp; What these discoveries or grounds of belief are I
shall proceed to give briefly, my limits not permitting the detailed
citation of authorities.&nbsp; First, then, there appears to be every
reason for believing with Captain Richard Burton that the J&#257;ts of
Northwestern India furnished so large a proportion of the emigrants or
exiles who, from the tenth century, went out of India westward, that there
is very little risk in assuming it as an hypothesis, at least, that they
formed the <i>Hauptstamm</i> of the gypsies of Europe.&nbsp; What other
elements entered into these, with whom we are all familiar, will be
considered presently.&nbsp; These gypsies came from India, where caste is
established and callings are hereditary even <!-- page 332--><a
name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 332</span>among
out-castes.&nbsp; It is not assuming too much to suppose that, as they
evinced a marked aptitude for certain pursuits and an inveterate attachment
to certain habits, their ancestors had in these respects resembled them for
ages.&nbsp; These pursuits and habits were that</p>
<p>They were tinkers, smiths, and farriers.</p>
<p>They dealt in horses, and were naturally familiar with them.</p>
<p>They were without religion.</p>
<p>They were unscrupulous thieves.</p>
<p>Their women were fortune-tellers, especially by chiromancy.</p>
<p>They ate without scruple animals which had died a natural death, being
especially fond of the pig, which, when it has thus been &ldquo;butchered
by God,&rdquo; is still regarded even by prosperous gypsies in England as a
delicacy.</p>
<p>They flayed animals, carried corpses, and showed such aptness for these
and similar detested callings that in several European countries they long
monopolized them.</p>
<p>They made and sold mats, baskets, and small articles of wood.</p>
<p>They have shown great skill as dancers, musicians, singers, acrobats;
and it is a rule almost without exception that there is hardly a traveling
company of such performers or a theatre, in Europe or America, in which
there is not at least one person with some Romany blood.</p>
<p>Their hair remains black to advanced age, and they retain it longer than
do Europeans or ordinary Orientals.</p>
<p>They speak an Aryan tongue, which agrees in the <!-- page 333--><a
name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 333</span>main with that of the
J&#257;ts, but which contains words gathered from other Indian
sources.&nbsp; This is a consideration of the utmost importance, as by it
alone can we determine what was the agglomeration of tribes in India which
formed the Western gypsy.</p>
<p>Admitting these as the peculiar pursuits of the race, the next step
should be to consider what are the principal nomadic tribes of gypsies in
India and Persia, and how far their occupations agree with those of the
Romany of Europe.&nbsp; That the J&#257;ts probably supplied the main stock
has been admitted.&nbsp; This was a bold race of Northwestern India, which
at one time had such power as to obtain important victories over the
caliphs.&nbsp; They were broken and dispersed in the eleventh century by
Mahmoud, many thousands of them wandering to the West.&nbsp; They were
without religion, &ldquo;of the horse, horsey,&rdquo; and notorious
thieves.&nbsp; In this they agree with the European gypsy.&nbsp; But they
are not habitual eaters of <i>mullo b&#257;lor</i>, or &ldquo;dead
pork;&rdquo; they do not devour everything like dogs.&nbsp; We cannot
ascertain that the J&#257;t is specially a musician, a dancer, a mat and
basket maker, a rope-dancer, a bear-leader, or a peddler.&nbsp; We do not
know whether they are peculiar in India among the Indians for keeping their
hair unchanged to old age, as do pure-blood English gypsies.&nbsp; All of
these things are, however, markedly characteristic of certain different
kinds of wanderers, or gypsies, in India.&nbsp; From this we conclude,
hypothetically, that the J&#257;t warriors were supplemented by other
tribes,&mdash;chief among these may have been the Dom,&mdash;and that the
J&#257;t element has at present disappeared, and been supplanted by the
lower type.</p>
<p>The Doms are a race of gypsies found from Central <!-- page 334--><a
name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 334</span>India to the far
northern frontier, where a portion of their early ancestry appears as the
Domarr, and are supposed to be pre-Aryan.&nbsp; In &ldquo;The People of
India,&rdquo; edited by J. Forbes Watson and J. W. Kaye (India Museum,
1868), we are told that the appearance and modes of life of the Doms
indicate a marked difference from those of the people who surround them (in
Behar).&nbsp; The Hindus admit their claim to antiquity.&nbsp; Their
designation in the Shastras is Sopuckh, meaning dog-eater.&nbsp; They are
wanderers; they make baskets and mats, and are inveterate drinkers of
spirits, spending all their earnings on it.&nbsp; They have almost a
monopoly as to burning corpses and handling all dead bodies.&nbsp; They eat
all animals which have died a natural death, and are particularly fond of
pork of this description.&nbsp; &ldquo;Notwithstanding profligate habits,
many of them attain the age of eighty or ninety; and it is not till sixty
or sixty-five that their hair begins to get white.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Domarr
are a mountain race, nomads, shepherds, and robbers.&nbsp; Travelers speak
of them as &ldquo;gypsies.&rdquo;&nbsp; A specimen which we have of their
language would, with the exception of one word, which is probably an error
of the transcriber, be intelligible to any English gypsy, and be called
pure Romany.&nbsp; Finally, the ordinary Dom calls himself a Dom, his wife
a Domni, and the being a Dom, or the collective gypsydom, Domnipana.&nbsp;
<i>D</i> in Hindustani is found as <i>r</i> in English gypsy
speech,&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, <i>doi</i>, a wooden spoon, is known in Europe
as <i>roi</i>.&nbsp; Now in common Romany we have, even in
London,&mdash;</p>
<p>Rom . . . A gypsy.</p>
<p>Romni . . . A gypsy wife.</p>
<p>Romnipen . . . Gypsydom.</p>
<p><!-- page 335--><a name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
335</span>Of this word <i>rom</i> I shall have more to say.&nbsp; It may be
observed that there are in the Indian <i>Dom</i> certain distinctly-marked
and degrading features, characteristic of the European gypsy, which are out
of keeping with the habits of warriors, and of a daring Aryan race which
withstood the caliphs.&nbsp; Grubbing in filth as if by instinct, handling
corpses, making baskets, eating carrion, being given to drunkenness, does
not agree with anything we can learn of the J&#257;ts.&nbsp; Yet the
European gypsies are all this, and at the same time &ldquo;horsey&rdquo;
like the J&#257;ts.&nbsp; Is it not extremely probable that during the
&ldquo;out-wandering&rdquo; the Dom communicated his name and habits to his
fellow-emigrants?</p>
<p>The marked musical talent characteristic of the Slavonian and other
European gypsies appears to link them with the Luri of Persia.&nbsp; These
are distinctly gypsies; that is to say, they are wanderers, thieves,
fortune-tellers, and minstrels.&nbsp; The Shah-Nameh of Firdusi tells us
that about the year 420 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> Shankal, the
Maharajah of India, sent to Behram Gour, a ruler of the Sassanian dynasty
in Persia, ten thousand minstrels, male and female, called
<i>Luri</i>.&nbsp; Though lands were allotted to them, with corn and
cattle, they became from the beginning irreclaimable vagabonds.&nbsp; Of
their descendants, as they now exist, Sir Henry Pottinger says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;They bear a marked affinity to the gypsies of Europe. <a
name="citation335"></a><a href="#footnote335"
class="citation">[335]</a>&nbsp; They speak a dialect peculiar to
themselves, have a king to each troupe, and are notorious for kidnapping
and pilfering.&nbsp; Their principal pastimes are drinking, dancing, and
music. . . .&nbsp; They are invariably attended by half a dozen of bears
and <!-- page 336--><a name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
336</span>monkeys that are broke in to perform all manner of grotesque
tricks.&nbsp; In each company there are always two or three members who
profess . . . modes of divining, which procure them a ready admission into
every society.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This account, especially with the mention of trained bears and monkeys,
identifies them with the Ri&#269;inari, or bear-leading gypsies of Syria
(also called Nuri), Turkey, and Roumania.&nbsp; A party of these lately
came to England.&nbsp; We have seen these Syrian Ri&#269;inari in
Egypt.&nbsp; They are unquestionably gypsies, and it is probable that many
of them accompanied the early migration of J&#257;ts and Doms.</p>
<p>The N&#257;ts or Nuts are Indian wanderers, who, as Dr. J. Forbes Watson
declares, in &ldquo;The People of India,&rdquo; &ldquo;correspond to the
European gypsy tribes,&rdquo; and were in their origin probably identical
with the Luri.&nbsp; They are musicians, dancers, conjurers, acrobats,
fortune-tellers, blacksmiths, robbers, and dwellers in tents.&nbsp; They
eat everything, except garlic.&nbsp; There are also in India the Banjari,
who are spoken of by travelers as &ldquo;gypsies.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are
traveling merchants or peddlers.&nbsp; Among all these wanderers there is a
current slang of the roads, as in England.&nbsp; This slang extends even
into Persia.&nbsp; Each tribe has its own, but the name for the generally
spoken <i>lingua franca</i> is <i>Rom</i>.</p>
<p>It has never been pointed out, however, by any writer, that there is in
Northern and Central India a distinct tribe, which is regarded, even by the
N&#257;ts and Doms and J&#257;ts themselves, as peculiarly and distinctly
gypsy.&nbsp; There are, however, such wanderers, and the manner in which I
became aware of their existence was, to say the least, remarkable.&nbsp; I
was going one day along the Marylebone Road when I <!-- page 337--><a
name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 337</span>met a very dark man,
poorly clad, whom I took for a gypsy; and no wonder, as his eyes had the
very expression of the purest blood of the oldest families.&nbsp; To him I
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Rakessa tu Romanes</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; (Can you talk gypsy?)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you mean,&rdquo; he answered in English.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You ask me if I can talk gypsy.&nbsp; I know what those people
are.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m a Mahometan Hindu from Calcutta.&nbsp; I get my
living by making curry powder.&nbsp; Here is my card.&rdquo;&nbsp; Saying
this he handed me a piece of paper, with his name written on it: <i>John
Nano</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I say to you, &lsquo;<i>Rakessa tu Romanes</i>?&rsquo; what
does it mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means, &lsquo;Can you talk Rom?&rsquo;&nbsp; But
<i>rakessa</i> is not a Hindu word.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
Panjab&#299;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I met John Nano several times afterwards and visited him in his
lodgings, and had him carefully examined and cross-questioned and pumped by
Professor Palmer of Cambridge, who is proficient in Eastern tongues.&nbsp;
He conversed with John in Hindustani, and the result of our examination was
that John declared he had in his youth lived a very loose life, and
belonged to a tribe of wanderers who were to all the other wanderers on the
roads in India what regular gypsies are to the English Gorgio hawkers and
tramps.&nbsp; These people were, he declared, &ldquo;the <i>real</i>
gypsies of India, and just like the gypsies here.&nbsp; People in India
called them Trabl&#363;s, which means Syrians, but they were full-blood
Hindus, and not Syrians.&rdquo;&nbsp; And here I may observe that this word
Trabl&#363;s which is thus applied to Syria, is derived from Tripoli.&nbsp;
John was very sure that his gypsies were Indian.&nbsp; They had a peculiar
language, consisting <!-- page 338--><a name="page338"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 338</span>of words which were not generally
intelligible.&nbsp; &ldquo;Could he remember any of these
words?&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; One of them was <i>manro</i>, which meant
bread.&nbsp; Now <i>manro</i> is all over Europe the gypsy word for
bread.&nbsp; John Nano, who spoke several tongues, said that he did not
know it in any Indian dialect except in that of his gypsies.&nbsp; These
gypsies called themselves and their language <i>Rom</i>.&nbsp; Rom meant in
India a real gypsy.&nbsp; And Rom was the general slang of the road, and it
came from the Roms or Trabl&#363;s.&nbsp; Once he had written all his
autobiography in a book.&nbsp; This is generally done by intelligent
Mahometans.&nbsp; This manuscript had unfortunately been burned by his
English wife, who told us that she had done so &ldquo;because she was tired
of seeing a book lying about which she could not read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reader, think of losing such a life!&nbsp; The autobiography of an
Indian gypsy,&mdash;an abyss of adventure and darksome mysteries,
illuminated, it may be, with vivid flashes of Dacoitee, while in the
distance rumbled the thunder of Thuggism!&nbsp; Lost, lost, irreparably
lost forever!&nbsp; And in this book John had embodied a vocabulary of the
real Indian Romany dialect.&nbsp; Nothing was wanting to complete our
woe.&nbsp; John thought at first that he had lent it to a friend who had
never returned it.&nbsp; But his wife remembered burning it.&nbsp; Of one
thing John was positive: Rom was as distinctively gypsy talk in India as in
England, and the Trabl&#363;s are the true Romanys of India.</p>
<p>What here suggests itself is, how these Indian gypsies came to be called
<i>Syrian</i>.&nbsp; The gypsies which roam over Syria are evidently of
Indian origin; their language and physiognomy both declare it
plainly.&nbsp; I offer as an hypothesis that bands of gypsies who <!-- page
339--><a name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 339</span>have roamed
from India to Syria have, after returning, been called Trabl&#363;s, or
Syrians, just as I have known Germans, after returning from the father-land
to America, to be called Americans.&nbsp; One thing, however, is at least
certain.&nbsp; The Rom are the very gypsies of gypsies in India.&nbsp; They
are thieves, fortune-tellers, and vagrants.&nbsp; But whether they have or
had any connection with the migration to the West we cannot
establish.&nbsp; Their language and their name would seem to indicate it;
but then it must be borne in mind that the word <i>rom</i>, like
<i>dom</i>, is one of wide dissemination, <i>d&#363;m</i> being a Syrian
gypsy word for the race.&nbsp; And the very great majority of even English
gypsy words are Hindi, with an admixture of Persian, and do not belong to a
slang of any kind.&nbsp; As in India, <i>churi</i> is a knife,
<i>n&#257;k</i> the nose, <i>balia</i> hairs, and so on, with others which
would be among the first to be furnished with slang equivalents.&nbsp; And
yet these very gypsies are <i>Rom</i>, and the wife is a <i>Romni</i>, and
they use words which are not Hindu in common with European gypsies.&nbsp;
It is therefore not improbable that in these Trabl&#363;s, so called
through popular ignorance, as they are called Tartars in Egypt and Germany,
we have a portion at least of the real stock.&nbsp; It is to be desired
that some resident in India would investigate the Trabl&#363;s.&nbsp; It
will probably be found that they are Hindus who have roamed from India to
Syria and back again, here and there, until they are regarded as foreigners
in both countries.</p>
<p>Next to the word <i>rom</i> itself, the most interesting in Romany is
<i>zingan</i>, or <i>tchenkan</i>, which is used in twenty or thirty
different forms by the people of every country, except England, to indicate
the gypsy.&nbsp; An incredible amount of far-fetched erudition has <!--
page 340--><a name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 340</span>been
wasted in pursuing this philological <i>ignis fatuus</i>.&nbsp; That there
are leather-working and saddle-working gypsies in Persia who call
themselves Zingan is a fair basis for an origin of the word; but then there
are Tchangar gypsies of J&#257;t affinity in the Punjab.&nbsp; Wonderful it
is that in this war of words no philologist has paid any attention to what
the gypsies themselves say about it.&nbsp; What they do say is sufficiently
interesting, as it is told in the form of a legend which is intrinsically
curious and probably ancient.&nbsp; It is given as follows in &ldquo;The
People of Turkey,&rdquo; by a Consul&rsquo;s Daughter and Wife, edited by
Mr. Stanley Lane Poole, London, 1878: &ldquo;Although the gypsies are not
persecuted in Turkey, the antipathy and disdain felt for them evinces
itself in many ways, and appears to be founded upon a strange legend
current in the country.&nbsp; This legend says that when the gypsy nation
were driven out of their country (India), and arrived at Mekran, they
constructed a wonderful machine to which a wheel was attached.&rdquo;&nbsp;
From the context of this imperfectly told story, it would appear as if the
gypsies could not travel farther until this wheel should
revolve:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody appeared to be able to turn it, till in the midst of their
vain efforts some evil spirit presented himself under the disguise of a
sage, and informed the chief, whose name was Chen, that the wheel would be
made to turn only when he had married his sister Guin.&nbsp; The chief
accepted the advice, the wheel turned round, and the name of the tribe
after this incident became that of the combined names of the brother and
sister, Chenguin, the appellation of all the gypsies of Turkey at the
present day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The legend goes on to state that in consequence of <!-- page 341--><a
name="page341"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 341</span>this unnatural
marriage the gypsies were cursed and condemned by a Mahometan saint to
wander forever on the face of the earth.&nbsp; The real meaning of the
myth&mdash;for myth it is&mdash;is very apparent.&nbsp; <i>Chen</i> is a
Romany word, generally pronounced <i>chone</i>, meaning the moon; <a
name="citation341a"></a><a href="#footnote341a" class="citation">[341a]</a>
while <i>guin</i> is almost universally given as <i>gan</i> or
<i>kan</i>.&nbsp; That is to say, Chen-gan or -kan, or Zin-kan, is much
commoner than Chen-guin.&nbsp; Now <i>kan</i> is a common gypsy word for
the sun.&nbsp; George Borrow gives it as such, and I myself have heard
Romanys call the sun <i>kan</i>, though <i>kam</i> is commoner, and is
usually assumed to be right.&nbsp; Chen-kan means, therefore,
moon-sun.&nbsp; And it may be remarked in this connection, that the
neighboring Roumanian gypsies, who are nearly allied to the Turkish, have a
wild legend stating that the sun was a youth who, having fallen in love
with his own sister, was condemned as the sun to wander forever in pursuit
of her, after she was turned into the moon.&nbsp; A similar legend exists
in Greenland <a name="citation341b"></a><a href="#footnote341b"
class="citation">[341b]</a> and in the island of Borneo, and it was known
to the old Irish.&nbsp; It is in fact a spontaneous myth, or one of the
kind which grow up from causes common to all races.&nbsp; It would be
natural, to any imaginative savage, to regard the sun and moon as brother
and sister.&nbsp; The next step would be to think of the one as regularly
pursuing the other over the heavens, and to this chase an erotic cause
would naturally be assigned.&nbsp; And as the pursuit is interminable, the
pursuer never attaining his aim, it would be in time regarded as a
penance.&nbsp; Hence it comes that in the most distant and different <!--
page 342--><a name="page342"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 342</span>lands
we have the same old story of the brother and the sister, just as the Wild
Hunter pursues his bride.</p>
<p>It was very natural that the gypsies, observing that the sun and moon
were always apparently wandering, should have identified their own nomadic
life with that of these luminaries.&nbsp; That they have a tendency to
assimilate the idea of a wanderer and pilgrim to that of the Romany, or to
<i>Romanipen</i>, is shown by the assertion once made to me by an English
gypsy that his people regarded Christ as one of themselves, because he was
always poor, and went wandering about on a donkey, and was persecuted by
the Gorgios.&nbsp; It may be very rationally objected by those to whom the
term &ldquo;solar myth&rdquo; is as a red rag, that the story, to prove
anything, must first be proved itself.&nbsp; This will probably not be far
to seek.&nbsp; Everything about it indicates an Indian origin, and if it
can be found among any of the wanderers in India, it may well be accepted
as the possible origin of the greatly disputed word <i>zingan</i>.&nbsp; It
is quite as plausible as Dr. Miklosich&rsquo;s very far-fetched derivation
from the
Acingani,&mdash;&rsquo;&Alpha;&tau;&sigma;&#943;y&alpha;&nu;&omicron;&iota;,&mdash;an
unclean, heretical Christian sect, who dwelt in Phrygia and Lycaonia from
the seventh till the eleventh century.&nbsp; The mention of Mekran
indicates clearly that the moon story came from India before the Romany
could have obtained any Greek name.&nbsp; And if gypsies call themselves or
are called Jen-gan, or Chenkan, or Zingan, in the East, especially if they
were so called by Persian poets, it is extremely unlikely that they ever
received such a name from the Gorgios of Europe.&nbsp; It is really
extraordinary that all the philologists who have toiled to derive the word
<i>zingan</i> from a Greek <!-- page 343--><a name="page343"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 343</span>or Western source have never reflected that if
it was applied to the race at an early time in India or Persia all their
speculations must fall to the ground.</p>
<p>One last word of John Nano, who was so called from two similar Indian
words, meaning &ldquo;the pet of his grandfather.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have in my
possession a strange Hindu knife, with an enormously broad blade, perhaps
five or six inches broad towards the end, with a long handle richly mounted
in the purest bronze with a little silver.&nbsp; I never could ascertain
till 1 knew him what it had been used for.&nbsp; Even the old ex-king of
Oude, when he examined it, went wrong on it.&nbsp; Not so John Nano.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know well enough what that knife is.&nbsp; I have seen it
before,&mdash;years ago.&nbsp; It is very old, and it was long in use; it
was the knife used by the public executioner in Bhotan.&nbsp; It is
Bhotan&#299;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the knife hangs the ivory-handled court-dagger which belonged to
Francis II. of France, the first husband of Mary Queen of Scots.&nbsp; I
wonder which could tell the strangest story of the past!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has cut off many a head,&rdquo; said John Nano, &ldquo;and I
have seen it before!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do not think that I have gone too far in attaching importance to the
gypsy legend of the origin of the word <i>chen-kan</i> or
<i>zingan</i>.&nbsp; It is their own, and therefore entitled to preference
over the theories of mere scholars; it is Indian and ancient, and there is
much to confirm it.&nbsp; When I read the substance of this chapter before
the Philological Society of London, Prince Lucien Bonaparte,&mdash;who is
beyond question a great philologist, and one distinguished for vast
research,&mdash;who was in the chair, seemed, in his comments on my paper,
to consider this sun and <!-- page 344--><a name="page344"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 344</span>moon legend as frivolous.&nbsp; And it is true
enough that German symbolizers have given us the sun myth to such an extent
that the mere mention of it in philology causes a recoil.&nbsp; Then,
again, there is the law of humanity that the pioneer, the gatherer of raw
material, who is seldom collector and critic together, is always
assailed.&nbsp; Columbus always gets the chains and Amerigo Vespucci the
glory.&nbsp; But the legend itself is undeniably of the gypsies and
Indian.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that there are certain catch-words, or test-words,
among old gypsies with which they try new acquaintances.&nbsp; One of these
is <i>kekk&aacute;vi</i>, a kettle; another, <i>chinamangr&#299;</i>, a
bill-hook, or chopper (also a letter), for which there is also another
word.&nbsp; But I have found several very deep mothers in sorcery who have
given me the word for sun, <i>kam</i>, as a precious secret, but little
known.&nbsp; Now the word really is very well known, but the mystery
attached to it, as to <i>chone</i> or <i>shule</i>, the moon, would seem to
indicate that at one time these words had a peculiar significance.&nbsp;
Once the darkest-colored English gypsy I ever met, wishing to sound the
depth of my Romany, asked me for the words for sun and moon, making more
account of my knowledge of them than of many more far less known.</p>
<p>As it will interest the reader, I will here give the ballad of the sun
and the moon, which exists both in Romany and Roumani, or Roumanian, in the
translation which I take from &ldquo;A Winter in the City of
Pleasure&rdquo; (that is Bucharest), by Florence K. Berger,&mdash;a most
agreeable book, and one containing two Chapters on the Tzigane, or
gypsies.</p>
<h3><!-- page 345--><a name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
345</span>THE SUN AND THE MOON.</h3>
<p>Brother, one day the Sun resolved to marry.&nbsp; During nine years,
drawn by nine fiery horses, he had rolled by heaven and earth as fast as
the wind or a flying arrow.</p>
<p>But it was in vain that he fatigued his horses.&nbsp; Nowhere could he
find a love worthy of him.&nbsp; Nowhere in the universe was one who
equaled in beauty his sister Helen, the beautiful Helen with silver
tresses.</p>
<p>The Sun went to meet her, and thus addressed her: &ldquo;My dear little
sister Helen, Helen of the silver tresses, let us be betrothed, for we are
made for one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are alike not only in our hair and our features, but also in
our beauty.&nbsp; I have locks of gold, and thou hast locks of
silver.&nbsp; My face is shining and splendid, and thine is soft and
radiant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O my brother, light of the world, thou who art pure of all stain,
one has never seen a brother and sister married together, because it would
be a shameful sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this rebuke the Sun hid himself, and mounted up higher to the throne
of God, bent before Him, and spoke:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord our Father, the time has arrived for me to wed.&nbsp; But,
alas!&nbsp; I cannot find a love in the world worthy of me except the
beautiful Helen, Helen of the silver hair!&rdquo;</p>
<p>God heard him, and, taking him by the hand, led him into hell to
affright his heart, and then into paradise to enchant his soul.</p>
<p>Then He spake to him, and while He was speaking <!-- page 346--><a
name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 346</span>the Sun began to
shine brightly and the clouds passed over:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Radiant Sun!&nbsp; Thou who art free from all stain, thou hast
been through hell and hast entered paradise.&nbsp; Choose between the
two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sun replied, recklessly, &ldquo;I choose hell, if I may have, for a
life, Helen, Helen of the shining silver hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sun descended from the high heaven to his sister Helen, and ordered
preparation for his wedding.&nbsp; He put on her forehead the waving gold
chaplet of the bride, he put on her head a royal crown, he put on her body
a transparent robe all embroidered with fine pearls, and they all went into
the church together.</p>
<p>But woe to him, and woe to her!&nbsp; During the service the lights were
extinguished, the bells cracked while ringing, the seats turned themselves
upside down, the tower shook to its base, the priests lost their voices,
and the sacred robes were torn off their backs.</p>
<p>The bride was convulsed with fear.&nbsp; For suddenly, woe to her! an
invisible hand grasped her up, and, having borne her on high, threw her
into the sea, where she was at once changed into a beautiful silver
fish.</p>
<p>The Sun grew pale and rose into the heaven.&nbsp; Then descending to the
west, he plunged into the sea to search for his sister Helen, Helen of the
shining silver hair.</p>
<p>However, the Lord God (sanctified in heaven and upon the earth) took the
fish in his hand, cast it forth into the sky, and changed it anew into the
moon.</p>
<p><!-- page 347--><a name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
347</span>Then He spoke.&nbsp; And while God was speaking the entire
universe trembled, the peaks of the mountains bowed down, and men shivered
with fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou, Helen of the long silver tresses, and thou resplendent Sun,
who are both free from all stain, I condemn you for eternity to follow each
other with your eyes through space, without being ever able to meet or to
reach each other upon the road of heaven.&nbsp; Pursue one another for all
time in traveling around the skies and lighting up the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Fallen from a high estate by sin, wicked, and therefore wandering: it
was with such a story of being penitent pilgrims, doomed for a certain
space to walk the earth, that the gypsies entered Europe from India, into
Islam and into Christendom, each time modifying the story to suit the
religion of the country which they invaded.&nbsp; Now I think that this sun
and moon legend is far from being frivolous, and that it conforms
wonderfully well with the famous story which they told to the Emperor
Sigismund and the Pope and all Europe, that they were destined to wander
because they had sinned.&nbsp; When they first entered Europe, the gypsies
were full of these legends; they told them to everybody; but they had
previously told them to themselves in the form of the Indian sun and moon
story.&nbsp; This was the root whence other stories grew.&nbsp; As the tale
of the Wandering Jew typifies the Hebrew, so does this of the sun and moon
the Romany.</p>
<h2><!-- page 348--><a name="page348"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
348</span>A GYPSY MAGIC SPELL.</h2>
<p>There is a meaningless rhyme, very common among children.&nbsp; It is
repeated while counting off those who are taking part in a game, and
allotting to each a place.&nbsp; It is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Ekkeri akkery u-kery an<br />
Fillisi&rsquo;, follasy, Nicolas John<br />
Queebee-qu&#257;bee&mdash;Irishman.<br />
Stingle &rsquo;em&mdash;stangle &rsquo;em&mdash;buck!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a very little alteration in sounds, and not more than children make
of these verses in different places, this may be read as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ekkeri, akai-ri, you kair&mdash;&aacute;n.<br />
Filissin follasy.&nbsp; Nakelas j&#257;&rsquo;n.<br />
Kivi, kavi.&nbsp; Irishman.<br />
Stini&mdash;stani&mdash;buck!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is nonsense, of course, but it is Romany, or gypsy, and may be
translated:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;First&mdash;here&mdash;you begin.<br />
Castle&mdash;gloves.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t play.&nbsp; Go on!<br />
<i>Kivi</i>&mdash;kettle.&nbsp; How are you?<br />
<i>Stini</i>&mdash;buck&mdash;buck.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The common version of the rhyme begins with:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>One</i> &rsquo;eri&mdash;two-ery,
&eacute;kkeri&mdash;&aacute;n.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But one-ry is the <i>exact</i> translation of &eacute;kkeri; ek or yek
being one.&nbsp; And it is remarkable that in</p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- page 349--><a name="page349"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
349</span>&ldquo;<i>Hickory</i> dickory dock,<br />
The rat ran up the clock;<br />
The clock struck <i>one</i>,<br />
And down he run,<br />
<i>Hickory</i> dickory dock.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have hickory or ekkeri again, followed by a significant
<i>one</i>.&nbsp; It may be observed that while, the first verses abound in
Romany words, I can find no trace of any in other child-rhymes of the
kind.&nbsp; It is also clear that if we take from the fourth line the
<i>ingle &rsquo;em</i>, <i>angle &rsquo;em</i>, evidently added for mere
jingle, there remains <i>stan</i> or <i>stani</i>, &ldquo;a buck,&rdquo;
followed by the very same word in English.</p>
<p>With the mournful examples of Mr. Bellenden Kerr&rsquo;s efforts to show
that all our old proverbs and tavern signs are Dutch, and Sir William
Betham&rsquo;s Etruscan-Irish, I should be justly regarded as one of the
too frequent seekers for mystery in moonshine if I declared that I
positively believed this to be Romany.&nbsp; Yet it is possible that it
contains gypsy words, especially &ldquo;fillissi,&rsquo; follasy,&rdquo;
which mean exactly <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> and gloves, and I think it not
improbable that it was once a sham charm used by some Romany fortune-teller
to bewilder Gorgios.&nbsp; Let the reader imagine the burnt-sienna wild-cat
eyed old sorceress performing before a credulous farm-wife and her children
the great ceremony of <i>h&#257;kk&rsquo;ni p&#257;nki</i>, which Mr.
Borrow calls <i>hokkani boro</i>, but for which there is a far deeper
name,&mdash;that of <i>the great secret</i>,&mdash;which even my best
friends among the Romany tried to conceal from me.&nbsp; This feat is
performed by inducing some woman of largely magnified faith to believe that
there is hidden in her house a magic treasure, which can only be made to
come to hand by depositing in the cellar another treasure, to which it will
come by <!-- page 350--><a name="page350"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
350</span>natural affinity and attraction.&nbsp; &ldquo;For gold, as you
sees, my deari, draws gold, and so if you ties up all your money in a
pocket-handkercher and leaves it, you&rsquo;ll find it doubled.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t there the Squire&rsquo;s lady, and didn&rsquo;t she
draw two hundred old gold guineas out of the ground where they&rsquo;d laid
in a old grave,&mdash;and only one guinea she gave me for all my trouble;
an&rsquo; I hope you&rsquo;ll do better by the poor old gypsy, my deari ---
---.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gold and all the spoons are tied up,&mdash;for, as the enchantress
observes, there may be silver too,&mdash;and she solemnly repeats over it
magical rhymes, while the children, standing around in awe, listen to every
word.&nbsp; It is a good subject for a picture.&nbsp; Sometimes the windows
are closed, and candles give the only light.&nbsp; The next day the gypsy
comes and sees how the charm is working.&nbsp; Could any one look under her
cloak he might find another bundle precisely resembling the one containing
the treasure.&nbsp; She looks at the precious deposit, repeats her rhyme
again, and departs, after carefully charging the housewife that the bundle
must not be touched or spoken of for three weeks.&nbsp; &ldquo;Every word
you tell about it, my-deari will be a guinea gone away.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Sometimes she exacts an oath on the Bible that nothing shall be said.</p>
<p>Back to the farmer&rsquo;s wife never again.&nbsp; After three weeks
another Extraordinary instance of gross credulity appears in the country
paper, and is perhaps repeated in a colossal London daily, with a reference
to the absence of the school-master.&nbsp; There is wailing and shame in
the house,&mdash;perhaps great suffering, for it may be that the savings of
years have beer swept away.&nbsp; The charm has worked.</p>
<p><!-- page 351--><a name="page351"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
351</span>But the little sharp-eared children remember it and sing it, and
the more meaningless it is in their ears the more mysterious does it
sound.&nbsp; And they never talk about the bundle, which when opened was
found to contain only sticks, stones, and rags, without repeating it.&nbsp;
So it goes from mouth to mouth, until, all mutilated, it passes current for
even worse nonsense than it was at first.&nbsp; It may be observed,
however,&mdash;and the remark will be fully substantiated by any one who
knows the language,&mdash;that there is a Romany <i>turn</i> to even the
roughest corners of these rhymes.&nbsp; <i>Kivi</i>, <i>stingli</i>,
<i>stangli</i>, are all gypsyish.&nbsp; But, as I have already intimated,
this does not appear in any other nonsense verses of the kind.&nbsp; There
is nothing of it in</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Intery, mintery, cutery corn&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or in anything else in Mother Goose.&nbsp; It is alone in its sounds and
sense,&mdash;or nonsense.&nbsp; But there is not a wanderer of the roads
who on hearing it would not explain, &ldquo;Rya, there&rsquo;s a great deal
of Romanes in that ere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I should also say that the word <i>na-kelas</i> or
<i>n&eacute;-kelas</i>, which I here translate differently, was once
explained to me at some length by a gypsy as signifying &ldquo;not
speaking,&rdquo; or &ldquo;keeping quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the mystery of mysteries of which I have spoken in the Romany tongue
is this.&nbsp; The <i>hokkani boro</i>, or great trick, consists of three
parts.&nbsp; Firstly, the telling of a fortune, and this is to <i>pen
dukkerin</i> or <i>pen durkerin</i>.&nbsp; The second part is the conveying
away of the property, which is to <i>lel d&#363;dikabin</i>, or to take
lightning, possibly connected with the very old English slang term of
<i>bien lightment</i>.&nbsp; There is evidently a great confusion of words
here.&nbsp; And the third is to <!-- page 352--><a name="page352"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 352</span>&ldquo;<i>chiv o manzin apr&eacute;
lati</i>,&rdquo; or to put the oath upon her, which explains itself.&nbsp;
When all the deceived are under oath not to utter a word about the trick,
the gypsy mother has &ldquo;a safe thing of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>hokkani boro</i>, or great trick, was brought by the gypsies from
the East.&nbsp; It has been practiced by them all over the world, it is
still played every day somewhere.&nbsp; This chapter was written long ago
in England.&nbsp; I am now in Philadelphia, and here I read in the
&ldquo;Press&rdquo; of this city that a Mrs. Brown, whom I sadly and
reluctantly believe is the wife of an acquaintance of mine, who walks
before the world in other names, was arrested for the same old game of
fortune-telling and persuading a simple dame that there was treasure in the
house, and all the rest of the grand deception.&nbsp; And Mrs. Brown, good
old Mrs. Brown, went to prison, where she will linger until a bribed
alderman, or a purchased pardon, or some one of the numerous devices by
which justice is evaded in Pennsylvania, delivers her.</p>
<p>Yet it is not a good country, on the whole, for <i>hokkani boro</i>,
since the people here, especially in the rural districts, have a
rough-and-ready way of inflicting justice which interferes sadly with the
profits of aldermen and other politicians.&nbsp; Some years ago, in
Tennessee, a gypsy woman robbed a farmer by the great trick of all he was
worth.&nbsp; Now it is no slander to say that the rural folk of Tennessee
greatly resemble Indians in certain respects, and when I saw thousands of
them, during the war, mustered out in Nashville, I often thought, as I
studied their dark brown faces, high cheek bones, and long straight black
hair, that the American is indeed reverting to the aboriginal type.&nbsp;
The Tennessee farmer and his neighbors, <!-- page 353--><a

very strongly indeed to the original type when robbed by the gypsies, for
they turned out all together, hunted them down, and, having secured the

354</span>SHELTA, THE TINKERS&rsquo; TALK.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;So good a proficient in one quarter of an hour that I can drink
with any tinker in his own language during my life.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>King
Henry the Fourth</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One summer day, in the year 1876, I was returning from a long walk in
the beautiful country which lies around Bath, when, on the road near the
town, I met with a man who had evidently grown up from childhood into
middle age as a beggar and a tramp.&nbsp; I have learned by long experience
that there is not a so-called &ldquo;traveler&rdquo; of England or of the
world, be he beggar, tinker, gypsy, or hawker, from whom something cannot
be learned, if one only knows how to use the test-glasses and proper
reagents.&nbsp; Most inquirers are chiefly interested in the
morals&mdash;or immorals&mdash;of these nomads.&nbsp; My own researches as
regards them are chiefly philological.&nbsp; Therefore, after I had
invested twopence in his prospective beer, I addressed him in Romany.&nbsp;
Of course he knew a little of it; was there ever an old
&ldquo;traveler&rdquo; who did not?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we are givin&rsquo; Romanes up very fast,&mdash;all of us
is,&rdquo; he remarked.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a gettin&rsquo; to be too
blown.&nbsp; Everybody knows some Romanes now.&nbsp; But there <i>is</i> a
jib that ain&rsquo;t blown,&rdquo; he remarked reflectively.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Back slang an&rsquo; cantin&rsquo; an&rsquo; rhymin&rsquo; is grown
vulgar, <!-- page 355--><a name="page355"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
355</span>and Italian always <i>was</i> the lowest of the lot; thieves
<i>kennick</i> is genteel alongside of organ-grinder&rsquo;s lingo, you
know.&nbsp; Do <i>you</i> know anythin&rsquo; of Italian, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can <i>rakker</i> it pretty <i>flick</i>&rdquo; (talk it
tolerably), was my reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well I should never a <i>penned</i> [thought] sitch a swell gent
as you had been down so low in the slums.&nbsp; Now <i>Romanes</i> is
genteel.&nbsp; I heard there&rsquo;s actilly a book about Romanes to learn
it out of.&nbsp; But as for this other jib, its wery hard to talk.&nbsp; It
is most all Old Irish, and they calls it Shelter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was all that I could learn at that time.&nbsp; It did not impress
me much, as I supposed that the man merely meant Old Irish.&nbsp; A year
went by, and I found myself at Aberystwith, the beautiful sea-town in
Wales, with my friend Professor Palmer&mdash;a palmer who has truly been a
pilgrim <i>outre-mer</i>, even by Galilee&rsquo;s wave, and dwelt as an
Arab in the desert.&nbsp; One afternoon we were walking together on that
end of the beach which is the antithesis of the old Norman castle; that is,
at the other extremity of the town, and by the rocks.&nbsp; And here there
was a little crowd, chiefly of young ladies, knitting and novel-reading in
the sun, or watching children playing on the sand.&nbsp; All at once there
was an alarm, and the whole party fled like partridges, skurrying along and
hiding under the lee of the rocks.&nbsp; For a great rock right over our
heads was about to be blasted.&nbsp; So the professor and I went on and
away, but as we went we observed an eccentric and most miserable figure
crouching in a hollow like a little cave to avoid the anticipated falling
stones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dikk &oacute; dovo mush adoi a gavverin lester
kokero</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; (Look at that man there, hiding himself!) said the
<!-- page 356--><a name="page356"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
356</span>professor in Romanes.&nbsp; He wished to call attention to the
grotesque figure without hurting the poor fellow&rsquo;s feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Yuv&rsquo;s atrash o&rsquo; ye baryia</i>&rdquo; (He is afraid
of the stones), I replied.</p>
<p>The man looked up.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re saying,
gentlemen.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s Romany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jump up, then, and come along with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He followed.&nbsp; We walked from rock to rock, and over the sand by the
sea, to a secluded nook under a cliff.&nbsp; Then, seated around a stone
table, we began our conversation, while the ocean, like an importunate
beggar, surfed and foamed away, filling up the intervals with its mighty
roaring language, which poets only understand or translate:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;  &ldquo;Thus far, and then no more:&rdquo;<br />
Such language speaks the sounding sea<br />
&nbsp;  To the waves upon the shore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our new acquaintance was ragged and disreputable.&nbsp; Yet he held in
his hand a shilling copy of &ldquo;Helen&rsquo;s Babies,&rdquo; in which
were pressed some fern leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you do for a living?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Shelkin gallopas</i> just now,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Selling ferns.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you understand?&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what we call it in <i>Minklers Thari</i>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
tinkers&rsquo; language.&nbsp; I thought as you knew Romanes you might
understand it.&nbsp; The right name for it is <i>Shelter</i> or
<i>Shelta</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out came our note-books and pencils.&nbsp; So this was the
<i>Shelter</i> of which I had heard.&nbsp; He was promptly asked to explain
what sort of a language it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, gentlemen, you must know that I have no <!-- page 357--><a
name="page357"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 357</span>great gift for
languages.&nbsp; I never could learn even French properly.&nbsp; I can
conjugate the verb <i>&ecirc;tre</i>,&mdash;that is all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m an
ignorant fellow, and very low.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been kicked out of the
lowest slums in Whitechapel because I was too much of a blackguard for
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; But I know rhyming slang.&nbsp; Do you know Lord John
Russell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I know a little of rhyming, but not that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it rhymes to <i>bustle</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&nbsp; <i>Bustle</i> is to pick pockets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, or anything like it, such as ringing the changes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the professor was &ldquo;in his plate.&rdquo;&nbsp; He knows
perfectly how to ring the changes.&nbsp; It is effected by going into a
shop, asking for change for a sovereign, purchasing some trifling article,
then, by ostensibly changing your mind as to having the change, so bewilder
the shopman as to cheat him out of ten shillings.&nbsp; It is easily done
by one who understands it.&nbsp; The professor does not practice this art
for the lucre of gain, but he understands it in detail.&nbsp; And of this
he gave such proofs to the tramp that the latter was astonished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tinker would like to have a wife who knows as much of that as
you do,&rdquo; he remarked.&nbsp; &ldquo;No woman is fit to be a
tinker&rsquo;s wife who can&rsquo;t make ten shillings a day by
<i>glantherin</i>.&nbsp; <i>Glantherin</i> or <i>glad&rsquo;herin</i> is
the correct word in Shelter for ringing the changes.&nbsp; As for the
language, I believe it&rsquo;s mostly Gaelic, but it&rsquo;s mixed up with
Romanes and canting or thieves&rsquo; slang.&nbsp; Once it was the common
language of all the old tinkers.&nbsp; But of late years the old
tinkers&rsquo; families are mostly broken up, and the language is
perishing.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 358--><a name="page358"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re readered soobri.&rdquo;&nbsp; (You are put in the
&ldquo;Police Gazette,&rdquo; friend.)</p>
<p>Our informant could give only a single specimen of the Shelta
literature.&nbsp; It was as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Barney Mucafee,<br />
With my borers and jumpers down to my thee (thigh).<br />
An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s forty miles I&rsquo;ve come to kerrb yer
pee.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This vocabulary is, as he declared, an extremely imperfect specimen of
the language.&nbsp; He did not claim to speak it well.&nbsp; In its purity
it is not mingled with Romany or thieves&rsquo; slang.&nbsp; Perhaps some
student of English dialects may yet succeed in recovering it all.&nbsp; The
pronunciation of many of the words is singular, and very different from
English or Romany.</p>
<p>Just as the last word was written down, there came up a woman, a female
tramp of the most hardened <!-- page 361--><a name="page361"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 361</span>kind.&nbsp; It seldom happens that gentlemen
sit down in familiar friendly converse with vagabonds.&nbsp; When they do
they are almost always religious people, anxious to talk with the poor for
the good of their souls.&nbsp; The talk generally ends with a charitable
gift.&nbsp; Such was the view (as the vagabond afterwards told us) which
she took of our party.&nbsp; I also infer that she thought we must be very
verdant and an easy prey.&nbsp; Almost without preliminary greeting she
told us that she was in great straits,&mdash;suffering terribly,&mdash;and
appealed to the man for confirmation, adding that if we would kindly lend
her a sovereign it should be faithfully repaid in the morning.</p>
<p>The professor burst out laughing.&nbsp; But the fern-collector gazed at
her in wrath and amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, old woman,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;do you know who
you&rsquo;re <i>rakkerin</i> [speaking] to?&nbsp; This here gentleman is
one of the deepest Romany ryes [gypsy gentlemen] a-going.&nbsp; And that
there one could <i>gladdher</i> you out of your eye-teeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave one look of dismay,&mdash;I shall never forget that
look,&mdash;and ran away.&nbsp; The witch had chanced upon Arbaces.&nbsp; I
think that the tramp had been in his time a man in better position.&nbsp;
He was possibly a lawyer&rsquo;s clerk who had fallen into evil ways.&nbsp;
He spoke English correctly when not addressing the beggar woman.&nbsp;
There was in Aberystwith at the same time another fern-seller, an elderly
man, as wretched and as ragged a creature as I ever met.&nbsp; Yet he also
spoke English purely, and could give in Latin the names of all the plants
which he sold.&nbsp; I have always supposed that the tinkers&rsquo;
language spoken of by Shakespeare was Romany; but I now incline to think it
may have been Shelta.</p>
<p>Time passed, and &ldquo;the levis grene&rdquo; had fallen <!-- page
362--><a name="page362"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 362</span>thrice from
the trees, and I had crossed the sea and was in my native city of
Philadelphia.&nbsp; It was a great change after eleven years of Europe,
during ten of which I had &ldquo;homed,&rdquo; as gypsies say, in
England.&nbsp; The houses and the roads were old-new to me; there was
something familiar-foreign in the voices and ways of those who had been my
earliest friends; the very air as it blew hummed tunes which had lost tones
in them that made me marvel.&nbsp; Yet even here I soon found traces of
something which is the same all the world over, which goes ever on
&ldquo;as of ever,&rdquo; and that was the wanderer of the road.&nbsp; Near
the city are three distinct gypsyries, where in summer-time the wagon and
the tent may be found; and ever and anon, in my walks about town, I found
interesting varieties of vagabonds from every part of Europe.&nbsp;
Italians of the most Bohemian type, who once had been like
angels,&mdash;and truly only in this, that their visits of old were few and
far between,&mdash;now swarmed as fruit dealers and boot-blacks in every
lane; Germans were of course at home; Czechs, or Slavs, supposed to be
Germans, gave unlimited facilities for Slavonian practice; while tinkers,
almost unknown in 1860, had in 1880 become marvelously common, and strange
to say were nearly all Austrians of different kinds.&nbsp; And yet not
quite all, and it was lucky for me they were not.&nbsp; For one morning, as
I went into the large garden which lies around the house wherein I wone, I
heard by the honeysuckle and grape-vine a familiar sound,&mdash;suggestive
of the road and Romanys and London, and all that is most
traveler-esque.&nbsp; It was the tap, tap, tap of a hammer and the clang of
tin, and I knew by the smoke that so gracefully curled at the end of the
garden a tinker was near.&nbsp; And I advanced to him, and as he glanced up
and <!-- page 363--><a name="page363"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
363</span>greeted, I read in his Irish face long rambles on the roads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-mornin&rsquo;, sorr!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an old traveler?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, sorr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you rakker Romanes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can, sorr!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Pen yer nav</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Tell your name.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Owen ---, sorr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A brief conversation ensued, during which we ascertained that we had
many friends in common in the <i>puro tem</i> or Ould Country.&nbsp; All at
once a thought struck me, and I exclaimed,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know any other languages?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sorr: Ould Irish an&rsquo; Welsh, an&rsquo; a little
Gaelic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sorr, all av thim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All but one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s that wan, sorr?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you <i>thari shelta</i>, <i>subl&#299;</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No tinker was ever yet astonished at anything.&nbsp; If he could be he
would not be a tinker.&nbsp; If the coals in his stove were to turn to
lumps of gold in a twinkle, he would proceed with leisurely action to rake
them out and prepare them for sale, and never indicate by a word or a wink
that anything remarkable had occurred.&nbsp; But Owen the tinker looked
steadily at me for an instant, as if to see what manner of man I might be,
and then said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Shelta</i>, is it?&nbsp; An&rsquo; I can talk it.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; there&rsquo;s not six min livin&rsquo; as can talk it as I
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, I think it&rsquo;s very remarkable that you can talk
Shelta.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 364--><a name="page364"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
364</span>&ldquo;An&rsquo; begorra, I think it&rsquo;s very remarkable,
sorr, that ye should know there is such a language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you give me a lesson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Troth I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went into the house and brought out a note-book.&nbsp; One of the
servants brought me a chair.&nbsp; Owen went on soldering a tin dish, and I
proceeded to take down from him the following list of words in

<p>There you are, readers!&nbsp; Make good cheer of it, as Panurge said of
what was beyond him.&nbsp; For what this language really is passeth me and
mine.&nbsp; Of Celtic origin it surely is, for Owen gave me every syllable
so garnished with gutturals that I, being even less of one of the Celtes
than a Chinaman, have not succeeded in writing a single word according to
his pronunciation of it.&nbsp; Thus even Minklers sounds more like
<i>minkias</i>, or <i>pikias</i>, as he gave it.</p>

<p>This was said within hearing of and in reference to a bevy of servants,
of every hue save white, who were in full view in the kitchen, and who were
manifestly deeply interested and delighted in our interview, as well as in
the constant use of my note-book, and our conference in an unknown tongue,
since Owen and I spoke frequently in Romany.</p>

<p>I also obtained a verse of a ballad, which I may not literally render
into pure English:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Cosson kailyah corrum me morro sari,<br />
Me gul ogalyach mir;<br />
R&#257;het m&#257;nent trasha moroch<br />
Me tu sosti mo d&#299;&#275;le.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming from Galway, tired and weary,<br />
I met a woman;<br />
I&rsquo;ll go bail by this time to-morrow,<br />
You&rsquo;ll have had enough of me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Me tu sosti</i>, &ldquo;Thou shalt be (of) me,&rdquo; is Romany,
which is freely used in Shelta.</p>
<p>The question which I cannot solve is, On which of the Celtic languages
is this jargon based?&nbsp; My informant declares that it is quite
independent of Old <!-- page 371--><a name="page371"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 371</span>Irish, Welsh, or Gaelic.&nbsp; In
pronunciation it appears to be almost identical with the latter; but while
there are Gaelic words in it, it is certain that much examination and
inquiry have failed to show that it is contained in that language.&nbsp;
That it is &ldquo;the talk of the ould Picts&mdash;thim that built the
stone houses like beehives&rdquo;&mdash;is, I confess, too conjectural for
a philologist.&nbsp; I have no doubt that when the Picts were suppressed
thousands of them must have become wandering outlaws, like the Romany, and
that their language in time became a secret tongue of vagabonds on the
roads.&nbsp; This is the history of many such lingoes; but unfortunately
Owen&rsquo;s opinion, even if it be legendary, will not prove that the
Painted People spoke the Shelta tongue.&nbsp; I must call attention,
however, to one or two curious points.&nbsp; I have spoken of Shelta as a
jargon; but it is, in fact, a language, for it can be spoken grammatically
and without using English or Romany.&nbsp; And again, there is a corrupt
method of pronouncing it, according to English, while correctly enunciated
it is purely Celtic in sound.&nbsp; More than this I have naught to
say.</p>
<p>Shelta is perhaps the last Old British dialect as yet existing which has
thus far remained undiscovered.&nbsp; There is no hint of it in John Camden
Hotten&rsquo;s Slang Dictionary, nor has it been recognized by the Dialect
Society.&nbsp; Mr. Simson, had he known the &ldquo;Tinklers&rdquo; better,
would have found that not Romany, but Shelta, was the really secret
language which they employed, although Romany is also more or less familiar
to them all.&nbsp; To me there is in it something very weird and
strange.&nbsp; I cannot well say why; it seems as if it might be spoken by
witches and talking toads, and uttered by the Druid stones, which are <!--

to come down by moonlight to the water-side to drink, and who will, if
surprised during their walk, answer any questions.&nbsp; Anent which I
would fain ask my Spiritualist friends one which I have long yearned to
put.&nbsp; Since you, my dear ghost-raisers, can call spirits from the
vasty deep of the outside-most beyond, will you not&mdash;having many
millions from which to call&mdash;raise up one of the Pictish race, and,
having brought it in from the <i>Ewigkeit</i>, take down a vocabulary of
the language?&nbsp; Let it be a lady <i>par
pr&eacute;ference</i>,&mdash;the fair being by far the more fluent in
words.&nbsp; Moreover, it is probable that as the Picts were a painted
race, woman among them must have been very much to the fore, and that
Madame Rachels occupied a high position with rouge, enamels, and other
appliances to make them young and beautiful forever.&nbsp; According to
Southey, the British blue-stocking is descended from these woad-stained
ancestresses, which assertion dimly hints at their having been
literary.&nbsp; In which case, <i>voil&agrave; notre affaire</i>! for then
the business would be promptly done.&nbsp; Wizards of the secret spells, I
adjure ye, raise me a Pictess for the sake of philology&mdash;and the
picturesque!</p>

(<i>The Northern Barrier of India</i>, London, 1877) there can be little
doubt that the Dom, or D&ucirc;m, belong to the pre-Aryan race or races of
India.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are described in the Shastras as Sopukh, or
Dog-Eaters&rdquo; (<i>Types of India</i>).&nbsp; I have somewhere met with
the statement that the Dom was pre-Aryan, but allowed to rank as Hindoo on
account of services rendered to the early conquerors.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
